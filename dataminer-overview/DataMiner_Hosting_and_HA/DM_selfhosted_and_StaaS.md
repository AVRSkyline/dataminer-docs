We can offer Storage as a Service (StaaS) – a powerful option where we manage the storage for you and have you save on infrastructure & IT maintenance costs. This means your DataMiner System will immediately benefit from being connected to a scalable and user-friendly cloud-native storage platform. Gone are the days of estimating your storage requirements in advance, placing specific VM orders, or configuring complex Cassandra and Elasticsearch clusters with the necessary replication and backup.

StaaS enables to connect your DataMiner System to a scalable and easy-to-use storage platform, without the effort of setting up and managing your own Cassandra and Elasticsearch cluster. You keep your DataMiner nodes self-hosted, and can use the above mentioned redundancy/high availability capabilities on these nodes, but we take care of the database nodes and redundancy implementations.

# DataMiner Hosting and High Availability

Due to its architecture, DataMiner is extremely resilient to all types of failures, also because this architecture has no single point of failure.

Skyline Communications offers 3 different hosting possibilities, each having their own strengths in term of redundancy and high availability options:

1. Self-hosting the DataMiner nodes and storage nodes
2. DataMiner nodes self-hosted / Storage nodes as a Service
3. DataMiner nodes and Storage nodes as a Service

# Dom Viewer

## Overview

Introducing the DOM Viewer, a cutting-edge Low-Code application designed to give you unparalleled insight and control over your DataMiner Object Model (DOM) definitions and instances.

Imagine being able to visualize complex DOM relationships effortlessly. With the DOM Viewer, you can explore how DOM definitions interconnect through an intuitive node-edge graph. Instantly access detailed information by simply hovering over definitions, revealing the module they belong to, the number of sections and fields, and more.

The DOM Viewer allows you to dive deeper by opening definition tables, where you can see a list of field descriptors filtered by section. Gain comprehensive insights into field details such as type, description, whether they are optional or mandatory, and their read-only status. Plus, the state transition graph feature lets you understand the lifecycle of instances, showcasing how they move between states.

Need a broad overview? The DOM Viewerâ€™s powerful table functionality lists all field descriptors across all definitions in every module, complete with extensive filtering options. The same robust features apply to all DOM instances, providing you with a holistic view of your entire DataMiner system.

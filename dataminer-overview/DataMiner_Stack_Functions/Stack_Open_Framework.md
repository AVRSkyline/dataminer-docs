## User-definable APIs

Create RESTful APIs on the fly, tailored to your use case.

With only a few clicks, by creating or selecting an automation script, you can publish that script as RESTful API. DataMiner provides an API endpoint and manages the tokens to authenticate with any third-party system in a secure and easy manner.

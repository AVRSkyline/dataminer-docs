# Questions related to Commercial models

## General

### What Commercial and Deploy models does Skyline offer?

Commercial models define how you pay for software and determine ownership and usage rights. We offer two models:

- Usage-based services
- Perpetual-use licenses

Deploy or Delivery models determine how that same software is deployed. We offer three models:

- Self-managed on private/public cloud or on-premises
- Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)
- Hybrid: self-managed DataMiner nodes with Storage-as-a-Service (STaaS)

Usage-based services can use any of the deploy models.

Perpetual-use licenses can be fully self-managed (DataMiner nodes and storage nodes) or hybrid.

### Can different commercial models exist in the same organization?

Yes. Licensing and usage are measured at the DMS (DataMiner System) level. An organization can have perpetual licenses on one DMS while running usage-based services on a different DMS.

### Can different commercial models exist in the same DataMiner System?

Yes, but limited. If a DMS has a perpetual license, it can only use "DataMiner.Services" and "STaaS" from the usage services.

### Can I transition my perpetual licenses into a subscription?

Yes. Your Account Manager will be able to provide more information and assist you with this.

### Are there any sign-up fees or one-time fees for usage-based models?

No.

### Can I use Professional Services credits in exchange for DataMiner credits?

No.

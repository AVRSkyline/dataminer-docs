# Questions related to commercial models

- **Can different commercial models exist in the same organization?**

  Yes. Licensing and usage are measured at the DMS (DataMiner System) level. An organization can have perpetual licenses on one DMS while running usage-based services on a different DMS. On the same DMS only one model can exist. 


- **Can I transition my perpetual licenses into subscription?**

  Yes. Get in touch with [your Account Manager](https://community.dataminer.services/get-in-touch/sales-team/).

- **Are there any sign-up fees or one-time fees for usage-based models?**

  No.

- **What level of support is included in usage-based services?**

  See [DataMiner Support Services](xref:Overview_Support_DMS_M_and_S).

- **Is outside business hours support available?**

  Yes, through an optional service subscription.

- **Can I use Professional Services credits in exchange for DataMiner credits?**

  No.

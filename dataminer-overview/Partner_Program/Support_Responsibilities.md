# Support responsibilities

When providing DataMiner Support Services as a partner, the responsibilities of **First Line Support** include:

- Acting as a first responder to calls and requests.

- Logging call details and capturing all relevant information (e.g. contact person, M&S status, problem specifics, software versions, steps to replicate/simulate issues, assessment of severity level/impact on customer operations, etc.).

- Addressing common inquiries, including FAQs, basic troubleshooting related to software usage, and checking against known issues identified and already documented by Second and Third Line Support.

- Ensuring thorough follow-up on all open tickets, serving as a SPOC for customers, and managing the case life cycle.

**Second Line Support** consists of specialized, fully trained DataMiner experts. Their responsibilities include:

- Dealing with more advanced user inquiries and system architecture questions, including basic analysis of underlying TCP/IP infrastructure issues (e.g firewall configuration) and OS-related configuration issues (e.g. domain integration).

- Identifying whether reported issues are likely related to system deficiencies, bugs, and/or conflicts with third-party software components.

# Logic

A protocol defines different components such as parameters, groups, triggers and actions. This section introduces the most frequently used components in a protocol and explains how these relate to each other.

> [!NOTE]
> A component always has an ID. This ID must be unique for all components of a given type. Some restrictions apply to the possible ID values that can be used (See <xref:ReservedIDs>). Additionally, a component may have a name and a description, which also must be unique for a given type.

- <xref:LogicTriggers>

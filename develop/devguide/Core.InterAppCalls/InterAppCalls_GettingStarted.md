# Getting Started

> [!NOTE]
> An example connector "Skyline Example InterAppCalls" is available in the [SkylineCommunications/SLC-C-Example_InterAppCalls](https://github.com/SkylineCommunications/SLC-C-Example_InterAppCalls) GitHub repository.

Begin by checking and applying everything to meet the DataMiner, DIS, connector and optional Automation script requirements.

Now there are 4 steps for development:

- [Creating an API with messages that define the data you want to share.](xref:InterAppCalls_GettingStarted_CreatingApi)
- [Creating executors that define how to process a message.](xref:InterAppCalls_GettingStarted_CreatingExecutor)
- [Receiving a call.](xref:InterAppCalls_GettingStarted_ReceivingCall)
- [Sending a call.](xref:InterAppCalls_GettingStarted_SendingCall)

# Account not licensed

## Problem

Even though DIS has become free, sometimes the license check fails.

## Possible solutions

1. Can you reach [SkylineAPI](https://api.skyline.be/Help)?
    - If not, check the certification and make sure it is allowed in your network.
1. Can you login to SkylineAPI?
    - If not, check if you are using the right credentials

In most scenario's the above will be enough. If the issue still persists, below are some other rare scenario's:

1. Check if your pc is still in sync with the time server
    - Maybe disable and enable again the synchronization. Windows is known to lie sometimes.

If nothing helps, please make sure to include the following information when reporting the issue:

1. Account that you use in DIS
1. 'DIS' [Output logging](xref:DIS_Troubleshooting_RetrieveInformation#visual-studio-output-logging)

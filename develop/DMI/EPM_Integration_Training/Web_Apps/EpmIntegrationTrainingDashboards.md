# EPM and Dashboards

Dashboards created with the [Dashboards app](xref:newR_D) are often used in the EPM Solution.

These frequently make use of EPM selectors. For more details on using EPM selectors, see [EPM selector](xref:DashboardEPMSelector).

If you have deployed the [EPM Integration Training](xref:EpmIntegrationTrainingAbout) package, the **Device Overview** and **Device Grid Overview** dashboard will be available. These dashboards leverage an EPM selector and serve as an excellent reference model for designing dashboards across various EPM fields.

# UPC Nederland Expert Cluster Trap Receiver

The **UPC Nederland Expert Cluster Trap Receiver** receives all alarm traps sent from other DMAs.

## About

This driver captures all alarm traps, in order to visualize what the active alarms on other clusters are.

## Installation and configuration

### Creation

#### SNMP main connection

This driver uses a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SNMP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP of the device, e.g. *192.168.10.2*

SNMP Settings:

- **Port number**: The port of the connected device, by default *161*.
- **Get community string**: The community string used when reading values from the device. The default value is *public*.
- **Set community string**: The community string used when setting values on the device. The default value is *private*.

### Configuration

To configure the driver, you must do the following:

- On the **General** page, the parameter **Trap Source IP** needs to be filled in. The value you fill in can be a single IP address or a comma-separated list of IP addresses. These addresses can contain \* and ? wildcards.
- On the DMA that will send the alarm traps, all the Custom Trap Bindings need to be included as a filter. For this, the elements can be selected of which the alarms need to be forwarded. However, note that information events should not be included in the alarm filter.

## Usage

### General

This page contains the **Trap Source IP** parameter. For more info on this parameter, refer to the "Configuration" section above.

This page also contains the **Alarm Traps** table, which displays all alarms that came in through traps. When an alarm is cleared, it will automatically be removed from the table. However, it is possible that alarms are not cleared, for example when the element is stopped on the source DMA. To manually delete a row from the table, select it in Cube, right-click and select the option **Delete Selected Rows**.

The driver processes the following bindings from a trap:

| **Binding**                  | **OID**                                                                                                                        | **Comments**                                        | **Mandatory**              | **Column Name in table Alarm Traps** |

### General (version 1.0.0.7)

From version 1.0.0.7 onwards, a queue is introduced in order to prevent all the alarms from being added to the **Alarm Traps** table immediately. The parameter **Maximum Active Alarm Count** defines the maximum number of active alarms (i.e. alarms with another severity than Normal (=5), in the Severity ID column) that can be present in the **Alarm Traps** table, before a new active alarm will be queued.

If there are more active alarms, these will be queued until there is room in the Alarm Traps table again. If an alarm goes back to state Normal while it is queued, it will be removed from the queue, and it will therefore never enter the Alarm Traps table. Alarms in the queue are processed in a first-in-first-out (FIFO) manner. This means that the alarm that first entered the queue will be the first alarm that leaves the queue and enters the Alarm Traps table.

The driver also allows the user to remove rows from the Alarm Traps table by selecting **Delete Selected Rows** from the context menu. When this action is executed and there are still alarms left in the queue, these alarms will be transferred to the Alarm Traps table, until either this table holds the maximum allowed number of active alarms or the queue is empty.

**Note**: When the Maximum Active Alarm Count parameter is changed during operation, two options are possible:

- The maximum number of active alarms is **increased**: In this case, alarms from the queue will be transferred to the Alarm Traps table, until either this table holds the maximum allowed number of active alarms or the queue is empty.
- The maximum number of active alarms is **reduced**: In this case, it is possible that the Alarm Traps table contained more alarms than is now allowed. If this is the case, alarms are queued back to the queue in such a way that these alarm will be processed first when there is room in the Alarm Traps table again.

***\[**version 1.0.0.12\]***From version 1.0.0.12 onwards, this driver works along with the **Ziggo SAM Event Combiner** driver.A new parameter called **Trigger IVR Type** was added to specify which table of the **Combiner** element the alarms' information will be sent to (HFC or B2B).Two new columns were added to the **Alarm Traps** table that display the results of the correlation process returned by the **Combiner** element:

- **Correlated Trigger IVR -** The most technical path that will group the alarms and generate one correlated alarm.
- **Impact -** This column will only be set on "HFC" trap receivers and displays the number of B2B alarms under a correlated alarm.

# Managing contacts

The *People Overview* page serves as the application's landing page. It allows you to switch between two tabs: *Overview* and *List*, each offering different perspectives on your contacts.

You can switch between the *Overview* and *List* tabs by clicking *Overview* and *List* in the header bar of the *People Overview* page.

- The *Overview* tab provides a **snapshot of key metrics** across teams, including the top 5 individuals in multiple teams, the most available skills, the number of contacts, deprecated contacts, and drafts, and the five most recently added contacts. This tab gives you a quick view of important information at a glance.

- The *List* tab provides an **overview of all contacts**, along with their state, email address, skill, experience level, and organization name. This tab allows you access and review contact details in one centralized location.

  To obtain more information about a specific contact, click the ![Details](~/user-guide/images/PO_Details.png) button in the corresponding row of the list.

## Searching contacts

To search within the list of contacts:

1. Navigate to the *List* tab.

1. Hover your mouse pointer over the contacts list.

   In the top-right corner of the list, you will see a magnifying glass icon.

1. Click the magnifying glass icon to activate the search bar.

1. Type in your search query.

   You can search based on any of the columns visible in the contacts list, such as name, state, email address, skill level, experience, or organization name.

   As you type, the list will dynamically update to show contacts that match your search criteria. For example, typing "Audio Mixer" will filter and display all contacts who have "Audio Mixer" listed as their skill.

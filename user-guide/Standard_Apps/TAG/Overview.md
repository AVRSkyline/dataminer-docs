# DataMiner TAG solution

The DataMiner TAG solution allows you to monitor and control individual TAG MCM devices as well as Media Control Systems (MCS).

The TAG management app seamlessly identifies the device type installed in the system and presents data from either a single MCS or all available MCM elements within the deployed DMS, without the need for any additional user configuration.

Within the TAG package, you can find the following items:

- TAG management low-code application
- TAG Video Systems MCM-9000 connector version 1.1.6.10
- TAG Video Systems Media Control System (MCS) connector version 1.0.2.1
- Automation scripts used in the application to gather data and perform device control operations

The TAG app contains three main pages containing information on the TAG devices:

- *Overview*: Displays general statistics such as the number of channels.
- *Channels*: Displays the status of each channel, allowing for some configuration and viewing of events.
- *Outputs*: Displays outputs within the TAG devices and allows for layout configuration.

For more information about how to install the package, see [Installation](xref:Installing_TAG_App).

# DataMiner TAG Solution

The DataMiner TAG Solution allows for monitoring and control of individual TAG MCM devices, as well as Media Control Systems (MCS). 
The TAG Management App seamlessly identifies the device type installed in the system, presenting data from either a single MCS or all available MCM elements within the deployed DMS, without the need for any additional user configuration.

Within the TAG package, you will have the following items:

- TAG Management low-code application

- TAG Video Systems MCM-9000 connector

- TAG Video Systems Media Control System (MCS) connector

- Automation scripts used in the application to gather and perform device control operations

The TAG app contains 3 main pages containing information on the TAG devices:

- Overview
    - Displays general statistics such as the number of channels
- Channels
    - Displays the status of each channel, allowing for some configuration and viewing of events
- Outputs
    - Displays outputs within the TAG devices and allows for layout configuration

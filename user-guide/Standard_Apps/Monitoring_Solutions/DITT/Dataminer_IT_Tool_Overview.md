# DataMiner IT Tools (DITT)

The DataMiner IT Tools (DITT) solution streamlines the monitoring and diagnostic processes for connectivity within a system.

Using DITT, you can initiate ping and traceroute commands to any device from the perspective of any system element. This enables a comprehensive view of the network and potential points of failure.

This solution enables you to swiftly identify network issues, assess latency and packet loss, and map the path that data follows through the network. This facilitates rapid detection and resolution of problems, minimizing downtime and optimizing network performance.

After [installing the DITT Package](xref:Installing_DITT) and [configuring](xref:Working_With_DITT) a visual overview, you can have DataMiner Cube ping or trace any device.

The DITT solution also allows you to [open PuTTY](xref:Open_Putty_with_DITT), assuming it is installed on the system. This functionality gives you effortless access to PuTTY from the DITT interface, facilitating SSH connections and remote network device management.

> [!NOTE]
> Before you can [configure the DITT PuTTY button](xref:Working_With_DITT), you first have to [install the DITT package](xref:Installing_DITT).

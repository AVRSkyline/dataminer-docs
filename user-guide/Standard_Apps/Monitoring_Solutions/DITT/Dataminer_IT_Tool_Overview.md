# DataMiner IT Tools (DITT)

The DataMiner IT Tools (DITT) Solution streamlines the monitoring and diagnostic processes for connectivity within a system.

DITT is designed to work seamlessly in the background, allowing you to initiate ping and traceroute (tracert) commands directly from the visual overview. This integration provides you with real-time diagnostic capabilities right at your fingertips, embedded within your visual interface. With a simple click on any device within the visual overview, you can instantly execute network commands, obtaining detailed insights into connectivity, latency, and packet loss.

This seamless integration means that you do not need to switch between different tools or interfaces to perform network diagnostics, significantly improving your workflow efficiency. By visualizing the network paths and potential points of failure directly within the system's overview, you can quickly identify and address issues without disrupting your ongoing tasks. This comprehensive view not only enhances your understanding of the network's health but also expedites the troubleshooting process, ensuring minimal downtime and optimal network performance.

You can use this solution to swiftly identify network issues, assess latency and packet loss, and map the path that data follows through the network. This facilitates rapid detection and resolution of problems, minimizing downtime and optimizing network performance.

After [installing the DITT package](xref:Installing_DITT) and [configuring a visual overview](xref:Implementing_DITT_in_Visio), you can have DataMiner ping or trace any device. To facilitate SSH connections and remote network device management, DITT also allows you to [open PuTTY](xref:Open_Putty_with_DITT), if it is installed on the client system.

The Nevion Video IPath application retrieve all data from the Nevion VideoIPath system via this connector (https://catalog.dataminer.services/details/7b986cbc-a29e-44e5-b3b7-003e639acfac), using Nevion’s modern services API calls. With this application it is then possible to schedule, execute and view connections between endpoints. This will not only estabelish a routing path but also configures a service that could be set up as point-to-point or point-to-multipoint.

# Using the Nevion Video IPath app

To access the application:

1. Go to `http(s)://[DMA name]/root`.

1. Select *Nevion Video IPath* to start using the application.

## The Nevion Video IPath interface

The sidebar on the left of the Nevion Video IPath application contains buttons to two pages: Connect and Services:

| Button | Page description |
|:--:|--|
| ![Connect](~/user-guide/images/Nevion_Connect.png) | Opens the [*Connect* page](#connect-page), which displays Profiles, Sources and Destinations. The connection between a source and a destination establishes a service.
| ![Services](~/user-guide/images/Nevion_Services.png) | Opens the [*Services* page](#services-page), which provides an overview of all available services.

## Connect page

The *Connect* page allows you to establish a connection between sources and destinations. Below are the steps needed to connect:

**Profiles**: The first step is to select a specific profile to see compatible sources and destinations. These profiles correspond to logical, predefined sets of configurations that apply to specific types of connections.

**Source/Destination Tags**: The second step is to select sources and destinations. Nevion allows you to use tags to categorize, filter, and organize sources (inputs) and destinations (outputs).

**Sources & Destinations**: Next, select a source and a destination to be connected.

**Connection buttons**: The final step is to click Connect or Disconnect to link or unlink sources and destinations. There are three buttons available: *Connect*, *Disconnect* and *Schedule*.

Additionally, there is a "Last Connection Status" display to show whether the connection was successful.

## Services page

The *Services* page provides an overview of the services in the system, which correspond to established connections between sources and destinations.

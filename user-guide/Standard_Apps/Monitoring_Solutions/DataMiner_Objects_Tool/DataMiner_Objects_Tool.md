# DataMiner Objects Tool

The DataMiner Objects Tool addresses the need for **finding, viewing and interacting with DataMiner objects**, offering an interactive automation script where the user can define a combination of filters to query the DataMiner system for any of the following objects:

- Reservation instances
- DOM instances
- Resources
- Profile parameters
- Profile definitions
- Tickets
- Service definitions

Once the result of the query has been manually finetuned, the user can choose to view the selected objects as JSON objects or the user can choose to delete the selected objects.

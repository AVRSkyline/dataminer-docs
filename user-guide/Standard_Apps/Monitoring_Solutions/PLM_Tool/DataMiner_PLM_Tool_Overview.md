# The DataMiner Planned Maintenance (PLM) tool

DataMiner Planned Maintenance is an application used for the scheduling and management of one-time or recurring maintenance windows for the various resources and entities within a system. From a single interface, system resources can be defined, maintenance windows can be scheduled, and historical maintenance records can be observed. The flexible nature of the application allows resources to be defined for any parameter on any connector within a DataMiner system. The output of the Planned Maintenance Tool can then be integrated in various ways to achieve the desired outcome, whether that be alarm masking, ticket suppression, etc. With this solution, users can create, edit, and delete maintenance events directly from the connector interface or from a low-code app.

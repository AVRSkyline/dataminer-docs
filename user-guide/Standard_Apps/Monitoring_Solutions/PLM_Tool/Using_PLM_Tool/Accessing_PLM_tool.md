# Accessing the PLM tool

To access the PLM app, follow these steps:

- Once the PLM app is pinned to the panel, simply click on it to open the web app.

- Sign in to the PLM app using your DataMiner Credentials. Enter your username and password when prompted.

> [!TIP]
> If you wish to access the PLM app without opening DataMiner cube, you can bookmark the web app. This will allow you to access it directly from your browser's bookmarks or favorites section. Alternatively, you can also access the PLM app from the DataMiner Home page. Simply open your browser and enter the following URL: https://DMAName/root/, replacing "DMAName" with the appropriate name or identifier for your DataMiner environment.

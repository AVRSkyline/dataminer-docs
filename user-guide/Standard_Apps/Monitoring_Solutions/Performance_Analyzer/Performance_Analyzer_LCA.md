# Problem

Let's consider the following example:

We have collected the necessary performance metrics from our solution, we now need to make decisions based on those results.

# Visualizing the performance

Collecting the data is only piece of the puzzle, if we want the solution to bring value, we need to be able to make sense of the data and make decision based on it. As humans, we often struggle to comprehend numbers, particularly when they are extremely large or, as is often the case with performance metrics, very small. This makes it essential to provide a more intuitive way to interpret the data, such as visualization. Performance Analyzer provides a generic LCA that works out of the box, along with collection of GQIs that allows us to visualize the data based on our specific needs.

1.	**Performance Analyzer Metrics Folder**: Defines the folder where performance data files are located. By default that folder is located at *C:\Skyline_Data\PerformanceAnalyzer*.
2.	**Files**: Shows a list of files available in the selected directory, with each fileâ€™s name, creation date, last modified date, and size. This table allows you to choose specific data file to analyze.
3.	**Collections**: Displays a list of all runs in the selected file. In Performance Analyzer terms, a "run" simply refers to the disposal of the collector.
4.	**Collections Filter**: Enables filtering of runs based on metadata, making it easy to locate a specific run or understand its context.
5.	**Collection Metadata**: Understanding the context in which a run occurred is crucial, and this section provides all the relevant details. 
6.	**Metrics**: Provides a detailed list of individual metrics, each representing a specific operation or method call. The table includes information such as class, method, start and end times, making it easier to identify which parts of the code impact the performance. 
7.	**Metrics Filter**: Allows filtering metrics by specific classes, methods, execution time ranges, or metadata.
8.	**Metric Metadata**: Understanding metrics without context is challenging, so this section provides it.
9.	**Timeline**: Visual representation of every metric. We can focus on a specific block by double-clicking its corresponding table entry for it.
10.	**Metric Metadata (Timeline)**: Provides overview of the context for selected timeline block.

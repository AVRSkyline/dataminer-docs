# Using the META WhatsApp Messaging solution

## Configuring the 'META WhatsApp Messaging' connector

For detailed instructions on configuring the *META WhatsApp Messaging connector*, visit the [*connector documentation*](https://docs.dataminer.services/connector/doc/META_WhatsApp_Messaging.html#configuration).

## Creating a correlation rule

1. Create a [correlation rule](xref:Adding_a_new_Correlation_rule).

   - Set the alarm filter: Define the specific alarms that should trigger this correlation rule.

   - Configure the action: Set the rule to execute the *META Alarm Detection* script.

   > [!TIP]

> You can create as many correlation rules and elements as you need to send different alarms to different contacts.

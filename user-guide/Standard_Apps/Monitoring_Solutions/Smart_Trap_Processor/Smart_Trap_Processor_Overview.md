# The Smart Trap Processor Tool

The Smart Trap Processor tool facilitates the configuration of rules for collecting, processing, and monitoring SNMP-based events from various sources.

Through a unified interface, users can [Configure Processing Rules](xref:Processor_configuration), and [Monitor Processed Traps](xref:Monitoring_Processed_Traps) for any of the processor elements available on the DataMiner system.

With this tool, you can specify which traps to capture, filter, transform, and display in a user-friendly application interface. The Trap Processor simplifies the monitoring of the most important system events and ensures appropriate alarm levels are assigned. The flexible nature of the application allows processing to adapt to most systems or devices generating trap events.

This solution empowers users to configure and monitor their processed trap events directly from the connector interface or from a low-code app:

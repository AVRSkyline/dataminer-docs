# Planned Maintenance Records

When a one-time PLM activity undergoes a status change from Active to Complete, or a recurrent PLM activity undergoes a status change from Active to Inactive, a new PLM record will automatically be added to the PLM Records table. This table serves as a repository for storing information related to PLM activities, providing a comprehensive history of completed or inactive PLMs. This behavior ensures that each significant status change is accurately recorded and tracked within the PLM system.

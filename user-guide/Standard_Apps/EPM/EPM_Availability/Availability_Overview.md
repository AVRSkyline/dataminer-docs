# Dataminer EPM Availability

The Dataminer EPM Availability Solution streamlines the management of a large amount of devices and endpoints, ensuring they are network-reachable. It offers an organized topology to identify whether issues are isolated to specific devices or affect larger regions.

Using Dataminerâ€™s topology application, you can view aggregated KPIs for all devices at every level, eliminating the need to monitor each endpoint individually. This high-level overview enables quick identification of relationships between low latency discrepencies and hubs.

Easily integrate your inventory system with the solution to keep the Availability topology current with all endpoints, no matter how many endpoints, ensuring you monitor critical elements and promptly detect outages.

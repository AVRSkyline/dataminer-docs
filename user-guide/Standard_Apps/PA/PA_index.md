# Process Automation

## Objective

This section is intended to become your one source for all information related to setting up and working with Process Automation (PA). This includes information on the product, architecture, development, and deployment.

All information applies to PA version 2. Features that are part of PA version 1 are omitted. A process that was running with the initial version of Process Automation is still supposed to run with PA version 2. However, it is using an architecture which is no longer promoted and will not allow to use the latest PA features.

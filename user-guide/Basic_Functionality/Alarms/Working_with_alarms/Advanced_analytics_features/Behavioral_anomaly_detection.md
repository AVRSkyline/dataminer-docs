# Behavioral anomaly detection

> [!TIP]
> This section contains information about behavioral anomaly detection in the Alarm Console. For more information on the functionality of this feature in general, see [Working with behavioral anomaly detection](xref:Working_with_behavioral_anomaly_detection).

Whenever behavioral anomaly detection finds an anomalous level shift, trend change, variance change, or flatline for a parameter, a "suggestion event" is generated in the Alarm Console.

These suggestion events can be viewed in a dedicated suggestion events tab, as alarms with severity "Information" and source "Suggestion Engine‚Äù. See [Adding and removing alarm tabs in the Alarm Console](xref:ChangingTheAlarmConsoleLayout#adding-and-removing-alarm-tabs-in-the-alarm-console).

You can also configure alarm templates to have alarms generated instead of suggestion events, depending on the parameter and the type of anomaly. See [Configuring anomaly detection alarms for specific parameters](xref:Configuring_anomaly_detection_alarms).

From DataMiner 10.4.11/10.5.0 onwards<!--RN 39945-->, you can [provide feedback on suggestion events and alarms](#providing-feedback-on-behavioral-anomalies) generated by behavioral anomaly detection. This feedback helps DataMiner improve its ability to decide when to trigger suggestion events or alarms. Prior to DataMiner 10.3.0 [CU20]/10.4.0 [CU8]/10.4.11, only the change point history of a parameter is considered when labeling behavioral anomalies.

Please note the following regarding suggestion events:

- Currently, no suggestion events are generated for outliers and unlabeled change points.

- Suggestion events generated to indicate a behavioral anomaly are automatically cleared 2 hours after their creation time or their last update time. From DataMiner 10.2.11/10.3.0 onwards, they are also cleared in case a new behavioral change is detected that ends the previous anomalous behavioral change. For example, when an alarm was created for an anomalous level increase at 1 PM, and a behavioral change point is detected at 2 PM when the level drops again, then the alarm created at 1 PM will be closed at 2 PM.

- Suggestion events generated to indicate a behavioral anomaly for [dynamic virtual elements](xref:Dynamic_virtual_elements) are generated on the child element. However, from DataMiner 10.3.0 [CU18]/10.4.0 [CU6]/10.4.9 onwards<!--RN 39707-->, suggestion events for [virtual functions](xref:srm_definitions#virtual-function) are generated on the parent element. Prior to DataMiner 10.3.0 [CU18]/10.4.0 [CU6]/10.4.9, these suggestion events are generated on the child element as well.

- Depending on the DataMiner version, different limitations are in place as to how many suggestion events can be generated for anomalous behavioral changes:

  - From DataMiner 10.4.0 [CU2]/10.4.5 onwards<!-- RN 39256 -->, at most 500 suggestion events related to behavioral anomaly detection can be shown in the active suggestion events tab of the Alarm Console.
  - From DataMiner 10.4.0 [CU1]/10.4.4 onwards<!-- RN 38674 -->, at most 50 new suggestion events per hour per type of anomaly (i.e. level shift, trend change, flatline, or variance change) can be generated per DataMiner Agent. There is no limit to the maximum number of anomaly alarm events, i.e. alarm events for parameters that have explicit [anomaly alarm monitoring configured in the alarm template](xref:Configuring_anomaly_detection_alarms).
  - From DataMiner 10.2.11/10.3.0 onwards, suggestion events are only created for the most significant changes, and per hosting DataMiner Agent there can be at most 500 open suggestion events related to behavioral anomaly detection.
  - Prior to DataMiner 10.2.11/10.3.0, suggestion events are created for all anomalous behavioral changes that do not have alarm monitoring enabled.

## Providing feedback on behavioral anomalies

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The anomaly feedback feature is in preview until DataMiner 10.4.11/10.5.0. If you use the preview version of the feature, its functionality may be different from what is described below. For more information, see [Soft-launch options](xref:SoftLaunchOptions).

The anomaly feedback feature is fully available from DataMiner 10.4.11/10.5.0 onwards<!--RN 39945-->. Prior to this, it is available in soft launch from DataMiner 10.4.4 onwards, if the soft-launch option [*AnomalyFeedback*](xref:Overview_of_Soft_Launch_Options#anomalyfeedback) is enabled<!--RN 38980 + 39944-->.

![Anomaly feedback feature](~/user-guide/images/Anomaly_Feedback.png)<br>*Alarm Console in DataMiner 10.4.11*

Whenever behavioral anomaly detection triggers a suggestion event or alarm, you can provide feedback (positive or negative) on it in the Alarm Console. Regularly providing feedback helps anomaly detection learn from it on a system-wide level, with input from all users. This allows more accurate detection of which change points to mark as anomalies across the system<!--RN 39623-->. Feedback applies to the same parameter instance, other instances of the parameter, and other elements using the same protocol.

Feedback can be provided via the ![Feedback](~/user-guide/images/Feedback_Column.png) column, which is visible by default in the *Anomalies* and *Suggestion events* tabs of the Alarm Console. To make the column visible in other tabs that list either alarms or suggestion events, right-click the column headers and select *Add or remove columns* > *Actions* > *Feedback*<!--RN 39640-->.

> [!TIP]
> See also: [*Improving anomaly detection using feedback* tutorial](xref:Anomaly_Feedback_Tutorial)

### Prerequisites

- Behavioral anomaly detection is enabled, and all its [prerequisites](xref:Advanced_analytics_trending) are met.

- [Storage as a Service (STaaS)](xref:STaaS) or an [indexing database](xref:Supported_system_data_storage_architectures).

- The [time to live](xref:Specifying_TTL_overrides) for trending is at least 1 day for real-time trending and 1 month for minute records.

### Providing feedback

<!--RN 39640-->

To provide feedback:

1. In the Alarm Console, open the *Anomalies* or *Suggestion events* tab. See [Navigating the light bulb menu](xref:Light_Bulb_Feature#navigating-the-light-bulb-menu) and [Adding a tab](xref:ChangingTheAlarmConsoleLayout#adding-a-tab).

1. Verify that the ![Feedback](~/user-guide/images/Feedback_Column.png) column is visible. If it is not:

   - Close the *Anomalies* or *Suggestion events* tab and reopen it. However, make sure not to use the *Reopen closed alarm lists* option. See [Adding a tab](xref:ChangingTheAlarmConsoleLayout#adding-a-tab).

     This step might be necessary if you have recently upgraded from a version of DataMiner that did not include the Feedback column to one that does (DataMiner 10.4.11/10.5.0 or higher). Since Cube saves your open tabs along with their column layout, the new column will not automatically appear in tabs that were open before the upgrade.

   - Ensure you are using DataMiner version 10.4.11/10.5.0 or higher, or confirm that the *AnomalyFeedback* option is included in the *SoftLaunchOptions.xml* file.

   - If possible, manually add the column by right-clicking the column headers and selecting *Add or remove columns* > *Actions* > *Feedback*.

1. Hover the mouse pointer over a suggestion event or alarm to view the ![Thumbs-up](~/user-guide/images/Thumbs_Up.png) and ![Thumbs-down](~/user-guide/images/Thumbs_Down.png) icons.

   - If you want to be notified of similar anomalies in the future, click the thumbs-up icon in the feedback column. Alternatively, you can right-click the suggestion event/alarm and select *Like*.

   - If you do not want to be notified of similar events in the future, click the thumbs-down icon. Alternatively, you can right-click the suggestion event/alarm and select *Dislike*.

   Once selected, the chosen icon will be pinned in the column as a black icon. If you change your mind, you can click the other option, and only the final feedback will be registered<!--RN 39082-->.

   > [!NOTE]
   >
   > - The ![Thumbs-up](~/user-guide/images/Thumbs_Up.png) or ![Thumbs-down](~/user-guide/images/Thumbs_Down.png) icons will only appear for alarms or suggestion events generated by the behavioral anomaly detection feature.
   > - You can only see the feedback icons you have clicked yourself. Feedback from other users is not visible.

The feedback you provide will be taken into account in the future.

Feedback on active alarms is saved in the user settings and will re-appear after closing and reopening Cube. Feedback on history alarms will disappear after restarting Cube, but it will still be used by SLAnalytics to improve the detection of future anomalies.

### Follow-up actions after providing feedback

After providing feedback on a suggestion event or alarm, a light bulb icon may appear next to the ![Feedback](~/user-guide/images/Feedback_Column.png) column. Clicking this icon will reveal a follow-up action based on your feedback<!--RN 39809 + 39640 + 39480-->. Alternatively, you can right-click the suggestion event or alarm and select the follow-up action from the context menu.

| Action | Description |
|--|--|
| Clear event | Clears the suggestion event immediately. No confirmation box will appear. |
| Improve alarm template | Opens a pop-up window suggesting changes to the alarm template, based on previous feedback for the parameter. At the top of the window, you can see the element and parameter name, along with a link to relevant documentation<!--RN 39616-->. At the bottom, it shows which elements using the same alarm template will be affected by the suggested template changes<!--RN 39729-->. A clock button allows you to view the current anomaly template configuration<!--RN 39640-->. |
| Create alarm template | Opens a card to create a new alarm template from scratch. |

![Suggested actions](~/user-guide/images/Suggested_Actions.png)<br>*Alarm Console in DataMiner 10.4.11*

If you provide feedback on multiple suggestion events for the same parameter, an action will only be suggested for the last one you gave feedback on<!--RN 39640-->.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - The actions listed above will only appear if you have the required permissions to perform them. For example, the system will not suggest updating the alarm template if you are not allowed to do so<!--RN 39480-->.
> - The *Improve alarm template* and *Create alarm template* actions will not appear if the element in question has an alarm template group assigned<!--RN 39666-->.

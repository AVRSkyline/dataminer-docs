# Viewing protocol documentation

For many protocols in DataMiner, documentation is available from within DataMiner Cube. This can for instance contain more information on the device the protocol is meant for, the various versions of the protocol, and the information that will be displayed on the element card.

There are several ways to access this documentation:

- From an element card:

  - Click the hamburger button in the top-left corner of the card and select *Help*, or

  - Go to the *Help* page in the card navigation pane.

- From the Protocols & Templates module:

  1. Go to *Apps* > *Protocols & Templates*.

  1. Right-click the protocol in question in the *Protocols* list.

  1. In the right-click menu, select *Help*.

> [!NOTE]
> If the *Help* option or page is unavailable, there is no documentation yet for the protocol in question.

> [!TIP]
> See also: [Connector documentation](xref:Connector_help_pages) in the DataMiner Development Guide.

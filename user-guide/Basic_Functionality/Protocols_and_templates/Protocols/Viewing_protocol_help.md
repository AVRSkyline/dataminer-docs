# Viewing protocol documentation

For DataMiner protocols provided by Skyline Communications, documentation is available which can be accessed from DataMiner Cube. This can for instance contain more information on the device the protocol is meant for, the various versions of the protocol, and the information that will be displayed on the element card.

There are several ways to access this documentation:

- From an element card:

  - Click the hamburger button in the top-left corner of the card and select *Help*, or

- From the Protocols & Templates module:

  1. Go to *Apps* > *Protocols & Templates*.

  1. Right-click the protocol in question in the *Protocols* list.

  1. In the right-click menu, select *Help*.

# Elasticsearch

If you choose not to use the recommended [Storage as a Service (STaaS)](xref:STaaS) setup but instead choose self-hosted storage, you need an indexing database in order to have access to all DataMiner features.

If you use a **dedicated clustered storage** setup, you can use [OpenSearch](xref:OpenSearch_database), the [Amazon OpenSearch Service](xref:Amazon_OpenSearch_Service), or an [Elasticsearch database on a Linux machine](xref:Installing_Elasticsearch_on_separate_Linux_machine). OpenSearch and the Amazon OpenSearch Service are supported from DataMiner 10.3.0/10.3.3 onwards.

If you use a setup with **storage per DMA**, [deploy an Elasticsearch database](xref:Configuring_indexing_database_per_DMS) to gain access to DataMiner features such as GQI, SRM, and DOM. If you want to use OpenSearch instead, switch to a [dedicated clustered storage setup](xref:Configuring_dedicated_clustered_storage).

In this section of the documentation, you will also find instructions on how to [manually connect a DMA to an existing Elasticsearch cluster](xref:Manually_Connecting_DMA_to_Elasticsearch_Cluster) in the *DB.xml* file, [configure Elasticsearch backups](xref:Configuring_Elasticsearch_backups), and [remove an Elasticsearch cluster node](xref:Configuring_Elasticsearch_node_remove).

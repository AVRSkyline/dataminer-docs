# Swarming

With the upcoming DataMiner Swarming functionality, you will be able to [switch objects](xref:SwitchingObjects), such as elements or services, from one DataMiner Agent to another Agent in that cluster.

The primary goal of Swarming is to eliminate downtime resulting from maintenance activities and provide a more polished user experience.

> [!NOTE]
> Swarming is only available in DataMiner Systems with a Cassandra and Elasticsearch database.

> [!TIP]
> As Swarming is **scheduled for production in Q4 of 2023**, we are working on adding more information to this section. Check back for updates frequently!

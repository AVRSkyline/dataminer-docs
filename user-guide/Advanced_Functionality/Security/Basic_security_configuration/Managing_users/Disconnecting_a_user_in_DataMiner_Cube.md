# Disconnecting a user in DataMiner Cube

In DataMiner Cube, users who have been granted the permission *Disconnect other users* can disconnect other users from a DataMiner Agent.

To do so using a DataMiner version from DataMiner 10.0.0/10.0.2 onwards:

1. Click the user icon in the top-right corner of the Cube UI.

1. In the menu, click *X online contacts* (X being the number of users that are currently online).

1. In the panel listing the users that are currently online, right-click the user you wish to disconnect.

1. In the context menu listing all current client sessions of the selected user, select either one specific session to disconnect or select to disconnect all sessions of this user.

1. In the *Motivation* box, enter the reason why you want to disconnect the selected user and click OK.

To do so using a DataMiner version prior to DataMiner 10.0.0:

1. Click the current user in the top-right corner of the screen to open the user console.

1. In the *Contacts* list, right-click the user you want to disconnect.

1. In the shortcut menu listing all current client sessions of the selected user, choose to disconnect either one specific session or all sessions of the user in question.

1. In the *Motivation* box, enter the reason why you want to disconnect the selected user session(s), and click OK.

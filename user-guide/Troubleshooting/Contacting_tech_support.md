# Contacting tech support

When you encounter an issue with the software and you need help to resolve it, contact DataMiner tech support by creating a ticket using the [User Operations Support web application](xref:User_operations_support) (also known as UOSA).

If for some reason you cannot access the User Operations Support web application and create a ticket, you can instead [contact Skyline's Support helpdesk](https://skyline.be/contact/tech-support).

# Remote Access Issues
Follow the guide below when you're encountering connections issues with dataminer.services features and your DataMiner System

## Check Status of DxMs
A common cause for issues with dataminer.services features and your DMS is due to the connection from the CloudGateway towards dataminer.services being unavailable. 
Resolve this by taking the following steps:
1. Verify whether the installed CloudGateway DxMs are running, otherwise start them.
1. Make sure to have the most [recent versions](https://docs.dataminer.services/release-notes/Cloud/DCP_change_log.html) of the DxMs installed to avoid dealing with issues that might have been fixed. 

## Check DMS Status
Verify the status of the DMS and ensure that the system is operational, if not, start the DMS. 

## Check Session
Verify in DataMiner Cube if the session is still available and not expired, otherwise renew the tokens.

## Undetermined Problem
When the previous solutions did not solve the problem, please contact [support](https://skyline.be/contact/tech-support).

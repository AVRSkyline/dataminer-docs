# Upgrade fails because of VerifyNoLegacyReportsDashboards.dll prerequisite

## Affected versions

DataMiner 10.4.0 or newer.

## Cause

From DataMiner 10.4.0 onwards, the [legacy Reporter](xref:reporter) and [legacy Dashboards](xref:dashboards) modules are *End of Life*. The *VerifyNoLegacyReportsDashboards* upgrade prerequisite check verifies that no legacy reports and legacy dashboards still exist before upgrading, as these will no longer work after the upgrade.

## Fix

Remove any existing legacy reports and legacy dashboards. Note that these can be used in other modules as well, like Automation and Scheduler.

The [Dashboards app](xref:newR_D) replaces the legacy Reporter and legacy Dashboards modules.

If you still rely on certain functionality and want to keep on using the legacy Reports &amp; Dashboards module, it's possible to enable them by configuring a [soft-launch option](xref:Overview_of_Soft_Launch_Options#legacyreportsanddashboards).

## Issue description

Upgrading to 10.4.0 or newer will disable the legacy Reporter and legacy Dashboards. Any scheduled reports generated by the legacy Reporter will no longer work. If you still have APIs deployed with this feature, they would be removed by the upgrade. This prerequisite check prevents this by forcing you to remove the deployments.

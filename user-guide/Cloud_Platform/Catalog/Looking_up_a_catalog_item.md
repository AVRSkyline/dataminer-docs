# Looking up an item in the Catalog

When you open up the Catalog module, a search box is displayed.

1. In the search box, enter (part of) the name of the item you are looking for (e.g. a connector, a package, etc.).

    As you type, a list with the top 5 results will be displayed under the search box.

1. As soon as you notice the name of the item you are looking for, click it and continue to the next step.

    If you cannot find the item you are looking for in this list you can choose to get a list of all the search results, by clicking the . This will open up the browse page. On the left side of this page you have filters that allow you to narrow down your search.
    If you only want to see the items that have been registered by your organization you can choose to toggle the "All/Public/Private" filter.
    1. **All**: this will return search results coming for all items in the catalog that you have access to. This includes the private items that are only visible for you organization.
    1. **Public**: this will only return results from the items that are publicly available for anyone.
    1. **Private**: this will only return results from the private items that are only visible for your organization.

1. Clicking on a specific item will open a page where you can see information about that item and its versions.

# DataMiner Express Edition

With DataMiner Express Edition you can deploy one free DataMiner System per [organization](xref:Pricing_Usage_based_service#organization). You can either deploy a self-hosted/on-premises DataMiner System, or deploy your DataMiner System in the cloud.

- Self-hosted/on-premises free DataMiner Systems are not time-limited. An organization can use the system as long as it remains connected to dataminer.services.
- [Free DataMiner Systems that are deployed in the cloud](xref:Deploying_a_DMS_in_the_cloud) are limited depending on your available DataMiner Credits.

## DataMiner Credits

DataMiner Credits are a flexible form of currency you can use to subscribe to DataMiner software and [hosting services](https://aka.dataminer.services/usage-based-pricing).

Credits will be deducted automatically when you consume usage-based services. For example, if you [deploy a DataMiner as a Service (DaaS) system](xref:Deploying_a_DMS_in_the_cloud) for a period of 1 week, 3 credits will be deducted.

> [!TIP]
> See also: [Usage-based services](xref:Pricing_Usage_based_service)

## Organization credit balance

Credits are owned by an [organization](xref:Pricing_Usage_based_service#organization), and can be consumed among the DataMiner Systems of that organization.

The credit balance of an organization is displayed in the [Admin app](https://admin.dataminer.services).

<!-- Every organization automatically receives 1 DataMiner Credit, which can be used to try out a DaaS system for 2 weeks for free. -->

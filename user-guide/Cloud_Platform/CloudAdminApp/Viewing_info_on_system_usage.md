# Viewing information on system usage

In the Admin app, you can view information about the usage of certain 'features' in a DataMiner System. Usage is reported in DataMiner credits.
Currently the only feature that reports usage data is Storage as a Service (STaaS), which reports amount of ingest operations per data type. The list of features will grow in the future. For more information about the metering and conversion rates, see this [Metering](xref:Pricing_Usage_based_service#metering-units).

## How to view your usage

1. In the [Admin app](xref:Accessing_the_Admin_app), select the desired organization. To select a different organization, click the organization selector ![Organization selector](~/user-guide/images/Cloud_Admin_Selector_icon.png) in the top-right corner and select the organization in the list.

1. In the organization overview menu, go to the Usage page.

1. On this page you can view the usage of your DataMiner Systems.
By selecting multiple DataMiner systems you can view the total usage for all of the selected systems. Note that filtering by month is always available, even if there is no usage for this period.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Organizations that do not use any of the features which currently support usage reporting will show an error message stating that there is no data found for this organization.

# DataMiner Credits

DataMiner Credits are a flexible form of currency you can use to subscribe to DataMiner software and [hosting services](https://aka.dataminer.services/usage-based-pricing).

Credits will be deducted automatically when you consume usage-based services. For example, if you deploy a DataMiner as a Service (DaaS) system for a period of 2 weeks, one credit will be deducted. <!-- link to DaaS docs -->

## Organization credit balance

Credits are owned by an [organization](xref:Pricing_Usage_based_service#organization), and can be consumed among the DataMiner Systems of that organization.

The credit balance of an organization is displayed in the [Admin app](https://admin.dataminer.services).

Every organization automatically receives 1 DataMiner Credit, which can be used to try out a DaaS system for 2 weeks for free. <!-- link to DaaS docs -->

# DataMiner Credits

DataMiner Credits are a flexible form of currency you can use to subscribe to DataMiner software and [hosting services](https://aka.dataminer.services/usage-based-pricing). See more about [usage-based services](https://aka.dataminer.services/usage-based-services-docs).

Credits will be deducted autmatically when you consume usage-based services. As an example deploying a new DataMiner as a Service (DaaS) system will deduct 1 credit for a period of 2 weeks. <!-- link to DaaS docs -->

## Organization credit balance

As explained in the [usage-based services docs](https://aka.dataminer.services/usage-based-services-docs#organization), an organization owns the credits, that can be consumed among its DataMiner Systems. 
The credit balance of an organization is displayed in the [Admin app](https://admin.dataminer.services).
Every organization will receive 1 DataMiner Credit, which can be used to try out a DaaS system for 2 weeks for free. <!-- link to DaaS docs -->

> If the app is used on a mobile device, to make optimal use of the available space on the screen, the app layout may be different from what is described in this section.

The Monitoring app header bar contains the following items, from left to right:

- Apps button: The button in the top-left corner provides quick access to other DataMiner web apps.

- *Monitoring* button: Click this button to return to the main page of the app at any time.

- Search box: The box in the middle of the header bar allows you to search the app. When you activate the box, a list of suggestions is displayed below it, based on the recent items list. This list of suggestions gets updated with search results as soon as you type in the box. Select a suggestion in the list to open the corresponding card.

# Installing DataMiner using the DataMiner Installer

The DataMiner installer allows you to run a DataMiner installation and perform the initial configuration.

> [!NOTE]
> The DataMiner software can only be installed on the C: drive. It is currently not possible to select another drive for the installation of DataMiner.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Avoid using duplicates of existing VMs to install a new DataMiner machine. Using cloned VMs can cause certain configurations from the previous DataMiner machine to linger and cause conflicts in the system.

## Before you run the installer

1. Make sure the necessary .NET and .NET Framework versions are installed. See [DataMiner Compute Requirements](xref:DataMiner_Compute_Requirements).

   > [!TIP]
   >
   > - For information on how to determine which versions you have installed. See <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/migration-guide/how-to-determine-which-versions-are-installed>.
   > - For installation information, see [Installation guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/install/).

1. Make sure the Windows setting "fast startup" is not activated.

1. Make sure the server is synced with an NTP server. If you intend to install multiple DataMiner Agents in a cluster, make sure all servers are synced with the same NTP server.

1. Make sure that no anti-virus software will interfere with the DataMiner installer and with the DataMiner software once it is installed. See [Regarding antivirus software](xref:Regarding_antivirus_software).

1. Make sure you have a Windows account with administrator rights. If you intend to use a DataMiner installer older than version 10.2, this must be the server's local Administrator account. For later installers, any account with administrator rights will suffice.

1. Download the DataMiner installer from [DataMiner Dojo](https://community.dataminer.services/download/dataminer-installer-v10-2).

> [!NOTE]
> The installation requires that [Npcap](https://nmap.org/npcap/) or WinPcap (deprecated) is installed for systems intended for DataMiner Failover based on virtual IP. If you intend to configure a [Failover setup based on hostname](xref:Failover_configuration_in_Cube), this software will not be needed.

## DataMiner installation

1. Make sure you are logged into Windows with the server's local Administrator account. Do not use a regular user account with administrative rights.

1. Double-click the setup executable.

1. Click *Install*.

   The progress of the installation will be displayed. A *cancel*Â button in the lower right corner allows you to cancel the installation process if necessary.

   Once the installation is complete, the configuration window will be displayed.

1. Click *Start*.

1. Select the desired database type, and click *Next*.

   These are the available database types:

   - [Storage as a Service (STaaS)](xref:STaaS) (recommended).

   - *Self-hosted - External Storage*: A regular [dedicated clustered storage setup](xref:Configuring_dedicated_clustered_storage). If you select this option, you will also need to fill in the connection details for both Cassandra and OpenSearch.

     > [!NOTE]
     > Make sure these clusters are active and reachable from the machine where you are installing DataMiner. You are responsible for the management of these external database clusters.

1. Fill in the required details to connect your DataMiner Agent to dataminer.services and click *Next*:

   - *Organization API Key*: Provide an organization key that has the necessary permissions to add DataMiner nodes in your organization. For more information on how you can add a new organization key to your organization on dataminer.services, see [Managing dataminer.services keys](xref:Managing_DCP_keys).
   - *System Name*: This name will be used to identify the DataMiner System in various dataminer.services applications.
   - *System URL*: This URL will grant you remote access to your DataMiner System web applications. You can choose to either [disable or enable this remote access feature](xref:Controlling_remote_access) at any time.
   - *Admin Email*: This email is associated with the dataminer.services account that has the administrator role for the organization.
   - *STaaS Region*: If you have selected to use [STaaS](xref:STaaS) for data storage, select the region where your data should be hosted.

1. Verify the selected configuration and click *Configure*

1. When the configuration is complete, click *Finish* to close the installer.

DataMiner will automatically start up, get licensed, and connect to dataminer.services. DataMiner Cube will also be installed, so you can connect to DataMiner locally.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> During the DataMiner installation, you are automatically added to the Administrator group by the installation wizard, giving you all Administrator rights in DataMiner. To grant others access to the newly installed DMA, log in to Cube using the same Windows account as was used to install DataMiner, and configure user permissions as described in [Basic security configuration](xref:Managing_users).

> [!NOTE]
>
> - To view detailed log information on the installation process, in the last step of the installer, click the *open log files* button.
> - After the installation, if you have [configured security](xref:Managing_users) so that there is at least one other user with full administrator rights, you can safely remove the account you used for the installation if necessary.

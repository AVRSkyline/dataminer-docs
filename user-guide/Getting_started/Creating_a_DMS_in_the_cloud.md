# Creating a DataMiner System in the cloud (DaaS)

> [!TIP]
> If you have any questions or need support with the DaaS feature, contact <daas@dataminer.services>.

With **DataMiner as a Service (DaaS)**, you can create a complete DataMiner System (DMS) in mere minutes. The DataMiner System is fully hosted in the cloud, so that you can immediately enjoy all the benefits of being connected to the [dataminer.services platform](xref:AboutCloudPlatform). As DaaS uses our [Storage as a Service (STaaS) solution](xref:STaaS), you will be able to make use of a scalable and user-friendly cloud-native storage platform. Scaling will be easy, both vertically (adding or removing resource), and horizontally (adding or removing nodes), whenever you need.

> You must be a member of an [organization](xref:Pricing_Usage_based_service#organization) to create a new DaaS instance and have sufficient DataMiner Credits.

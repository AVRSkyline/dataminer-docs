# Removing a DaaS system


> [!WARNING]
> When you remove a DaaS system, the system will be decomissioned. The DataMiner System can still be recovered upon request by contacting [daas@dataminer.services](mailto:daas@dataminer.services), however the cloud identity and shares will be lost and it will receive a new cloud identity within your organization upon recovery.

1. In order to remove a DaaS system, you must have the necessary permissions for this system on dataminer.services in your organization. On the dataminer.services page, click the ellipsis ("...") button in the top-right corner of the box representing the system and select *Delete DMS*. 

1. Fill in the name of the system to confirm that this is the system you want to remove.

1. Click *Delete*.

> [!NOTE]
> If you select *Delete DMS* for a self-hosted DataMiner System instead of a DaaS system, this will disconnect the system from dataminer.services. See [Permanently disconnecting from dataminer.services](xref:Disconnecting_from_dataminer.services#permanently-disconnecting-from-dataminerservices).

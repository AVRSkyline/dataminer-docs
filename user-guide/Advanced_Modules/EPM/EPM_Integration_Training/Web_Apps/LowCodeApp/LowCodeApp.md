## EPM Integration Training App

Upon the deployment and configuration of the EPM Integration Training package, users gain access to the specialized "EPM Integration Training" low-code application, designed to facilitate a hands-on understanding of EPM systems.

### Topology Chains Page

This page features intuitively designed buttons corresponding to each topology type. Clicking a button launches a popup window showcasing the topology chain filter, directly linking to the Monitoring app for a filtered view based on the chain name. For example: `http(s)://<DMA IP>/monitoring/element/<DMA ID>/<element ID>/chain/<chain name>`.

### Entities Overview Page

The Entities Overview Page aims to illustrate the application of foreign keys in filtering EPM tables, showcasing how to streamline the viewing and management of interconnected data within the EPM ecosystem.

### Customer Page

Here, we utilize the EPM feed to specifically filter customer information within the EPM customer table. This approach simplifies the process of accessing and analyzing customer data by applying targeted filters to streamline data searches.

# EPM and Dashboards

Dashboards created with the [Dashboards app](xref:newR_D) are often used in the EPM Solution.

These frequently make use of EPM feeds. For more details on using EPM feeds, see [EPM feed](xref:DashboardCPEFeed).

When you have deployed the *EPM Integration Training* package, the **Device Overview** dashboard will be available. This dashboard leverages an EPM feed and serves as an excellent reference model for designing dashboards across various EPM fields.

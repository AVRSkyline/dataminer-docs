# View Impact

EPM provides the ability to link EPM Objects to views using the [viewImpact](xref:ColumnOptionOptionsOverview#viewimpact) table column option.

This will allow a new alarm icon to appear next to the View in the surveyor. Instead of just the bar that shows the highest alarm severity below that view, a circle appears that shows the alarm severity of the EPM Entity. Below North America, USA, and USA West are EPM Entities linked to a view using this option.

## Titlebox Data section

The native look of the Data section of an EPM Entity is two columns filled with all of the information in two columns related to the row of the entity in the column order of the table. All columns that are shown are also shown in the Data section. If a column has width=0, then it will not show in this section and will be unable to be shown.

To further configure the look of the data section and also add title boxes, you need to create a page called CPEIntegration/[EPM System Type] i.e. CPEIntegration/Region.

On this page, you may add parameters as you would any other page, but you may also add individual column parameters associated with the entity. If using duplicateAs option, both the native and view table column will occupy the same space but will not cause issues in DataMiner.

## Linking collector data to an EPM object

All alarms generated by the EPM Manager protocol (the FE and BE elements) all have alarm properties that link the alarm to the EPM Entity system wide. These properties are the System Name and System Type.

It is also possible to have alarms generated at the Collector level to the EPM object by adding the Topologies tag to the Collector protocol and adding the [Exposer](xref:Protocol.Topologies.Topology.Cell.Exposer#remarks) options. The name of the Cell is the System Type and the specified column will be the System Name. If not specified column is provided, the Display Key of the table will be used.

You are also able to link multiple rows to one object and have a table of all linked rows appear in the Data section of the EPM Entity.

## EPM configuration

There are a couple of options that are required for the EPM protocol to have so the DMS knows which element in the Frontend of the system. First is a parameter named “Elementmanagertype” and the other is having the Protocol.Display@type attribute set to "element manager". More information can be found here: [EPM Integration in Cube](xref:AdvancedEpm)

 On startup, the DMS will crawl through the system to find which element has these conditions met to establish as the Frontend. To avoid having to do this crawl, you can set this property using an Automation script. The [EpmConfig](https://catalog.dataminer.services/details/automation-script/3713) script will do so after inputting the Dataminer and Element ID of the Frontend.

### Topology soft launch

To see the topology app in Cube, you must enable the [soft-launch option](xref:Overview_of_Soft_Launch_Options#cpeintegration) on all DMAs you would like to see the app on. This can be done by creating a file, if not already present, called “SoftLaunchOptions.xml” on the root directory of the Skyline DataMiner folder that has the following:

```xml
<SLNet>
   <CPEIntegration>true</CPEIntegration>
</SLNet>
```

### Renaming chains and fields

You can change the names of all the Topology Chains and Fields without making changes to the protocol. This change will also apply to alarms, so any new alarms will now be created with the new SystemTypes to ensure alarm linking works. To do this, create a file name [EPMConfig.xml](xref:EPMConfig_xml) in the Skyline Dataminer root directory and override any of the Chain/Field tags using the same syntax as in the protocol. I.E.

```xml
<Protocol>
  <Topologies>
    <Topology>
      <Cell name="Vendor" override="Manufacturer"/>
      <Cell name="Station" override="Node"/>
    </Topology>
  </Topologies>
  <Chains>
    <Chain name="Vendor Topology" override="Manufacturer Topology">
      <Field name="Vendor" override="Manufacturer"/>
    </Chain>
    <Chain name="Location Topology">
      <Field name="Station" override="Node"/>
    </Chain>
  </Chains>
</Protocol>
```

This can also be done with any collectors using the exposer logic by putting a similar file in the C:\Skyline DataMiner\Elements\<ElementName>\ directory.

## SLScripting processes per collector

The collectors in an EPM environment are the powerhouses in the solution. Because of this, one typically wants to ensure that they are given all the resources they can. To do so you can [create more](xref:Configuration_of_DataMiner_processes#configuring-a-separate-slprotocol-process-for-every-protocol-used) SLProtocol/SLScripting processes and/or create a SLProtocol/SLScripting process for [every element running a specified protocol](xref:Configuration_of_DataMiner_processes#configuring-separate-slprotocol-and-slscripting-instances-for-a-specific-protocol).

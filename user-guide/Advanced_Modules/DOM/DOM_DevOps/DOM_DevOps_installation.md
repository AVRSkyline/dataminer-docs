   > If you want to check what your data model looks like in a DataMiner low-code app, you will also need to make sure that the *DOMManager* [soft-launch option](xref:SoftLaunchOptions) is enabled, and that the system has the necessary [licenses to use DataMiner Low-Code Apps](xref:Pricing_Perpetual_Use_Licensing#optional-functions).

1. Place the app package on the server where DataMiner is installed.

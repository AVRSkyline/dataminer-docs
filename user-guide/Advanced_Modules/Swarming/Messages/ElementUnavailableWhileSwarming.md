# Message: "_ElementName_" is currently switching

When an element is switching over from being hosted on one DataMiner agent to being hosted on another DataMiner agent, it will be temporarily unavailable for opening element cards or changing element configuration.

In this case, DataMiner Cube will show a message indicating that the element is switching.

Once the element has completed its move, it will become available again.

# Configuring feed components

To have a component depend on other components for its data input:

1. Add the component(s) you want to the dashboard or low-code app. The following components can be used to pass data input to other components:

   - [Time range](xref:DashboardTimeRange)

   - [List](xref:DashboardList)

   - [Tree](xref:DashboardTree)

   - [Parameter picker](xref:DashboardParameterPicker)

   - [EPM picker](xref:DashboardEPMPicker)

   - [Query filter](xref:DashboardQueryFilter)

   - [Trigger](xref:DashboardTrigger)

1. Use the components above as a data source. See [Applying a data source](xref:Apply_Data_Source).

> [!NOTE]
> It is possible to have a dashboard depend on data in a URL without containing any dedicated components. See [Configuring a dashboard to use data in a URL without a dedicated component](xref:Using_data_in_URL_without_dedicated_component).

# Using data in a URL without a dedicated component

You can link a component to data in the URL without relying on specific components in the dashboard.

To do so, when you are configuring the dashboard:

1. Select the component you want to link to a URL.

1. In the *Data* tab, go to *URL*, and drag the URL category you want to use to the component. Prior to DataMiner 10.3.0 [CU21]/10.4.0 [CU9]/10.4.12<!--RN 41141-->, go to *Feeds* > *URL* in the *Data* tab.

> [!NOTE]
> When the dashboard has a specific component that contains the same data as the URL, that data will overwrite the data from the URL.

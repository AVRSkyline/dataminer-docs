# Chaining actions

This tutorial explains how you can chain actions one after another.

Expected duration: 10 minutes

## Overview

- [Step 1: Install the dummy data sources package](#step-1-install-the-dummy-data-sources-package)
- [Step 2: Create the simulated network scan script](#step-2-create-the-simulated-network-scan-script)
- [Step 3: Create and configure the header button](#step-3-create-and-configure-the-header-button)
- [Step 4: Chain an action](#step-4-chain-an-action)

## Prerequisites

- A DataMiner System that is [connected to dataminer.services](xref:Connecting_your_DataMiner_System_to_the_cloud).
- This exercise is continuing on the [Showing a panel](xref:Tutorial_Apps_Panel) tutorial.

## Step 1: Install the dummy data sources package

1. Go to <https://catalog.dataminer.services/catalog/5410>

1. Click the *Deploy* button to deploy the *IPAM - GQI dummy data sources* packages on your DMA.

   This package contains some data which will be used throughout the tutorial.

## Step 2: Create the simulated network scan script

1. Navigate to the **Automation** module within Cube. Create or use the "Utility" folder. Within this folder, generate a new automation script named "Touch".

1. Add a script parameter named "Path" which will contain the path of the file we are going to create or update.

1. Add a C# action containing the following code:

```csharp
engine.Sleep(5000);

string filePath = engine.GetScriptParam("Path")?.Value;

if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(filePath))
    throw new ArgumentException("Invalid file path argument");

using (FileStream fs = File.Create(filePath))
{
    fs.Close();
}
```

Your script should look like this. Verify its functionality by running the script, providing a path when prompted and check if the file is created or updated.

> [!NOTE]
> This script invalidates the data that is generated by the "IP addresses - Dummy" which will cause the data to be different when querying it again.

## Step 3: Create and configure the header button

1. Make sure you are editing the app and go to the "Metrics" panel.

1. Click the "+" icon on the left side of the header bar to add a button. Set its name to "Scan" and apply a suiting icon.

1. Configure the button to execute the script we created in step 2. The configuration should look like this:

   ![Scan action](~/user-guide/images/ScanAction.png)

## Step 4: Chain an action

1. Click "Upon completion" on the action you have just created to chain a new action to it. This chained action will execute after the preceeding has completed. The script we created has a 5 second duration which means the newly created action will only execute after that time.

1. Configure the consecutive action to perform a component action. Here we want to fetch the data for our state component again so that it's up to date after the network scan. The complete configuration should look like this:

   ![Consecutive action](~/user-guide/images/ConsecutiveAction.png)

1. Close the action editor and publish the app. Verify that clicking the "Scan" button on the "Metrics" page runs the "Touch" script and after 5 seconds the state component shows the latest amount of subnets.

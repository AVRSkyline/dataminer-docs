# Get resources

Available from DataMiner 10.3.11/10.4.0 onwards<!--RN 36970-->. The *Get resources* data source allows you to filter resources by resource pool ID or booking ID.

Depending on your DataMiner version, you may need to enable the [*GenericInterface* soft-launch option](xref:Overview_of_Soft_Launch_Options#genericinterface).

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Future DataMiner versions may already include this feature. To check the release version of a soft-launch option, see [Overview of soft-launch options](xref:Overview_of_Soft_Launch_Options).
> - The *Get resources* data source is only available on DataMiner Systems with a *ResourceManager* license and/or an *IDP* license.

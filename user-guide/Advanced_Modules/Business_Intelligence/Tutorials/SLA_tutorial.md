# Using DataMiner business intelligence to manage and monitor your SLAs

This tutorial will show you how to configure and use a Service Level Agreement (SLA) to monitor a power service. You will learn to customize SLA parameters to track service metrics towards high availability compliance.

Because services are at the heart of SLAs, you will also learn how to use a existing service as the starting point for SLA management.

You will also see how to configure and alarm template to monitor and visualize alarms for City streets affected by power service degradation.

Expected duration: 20 minutes

## Prerequisites

- A DataMiner System that is [connected to dataminer.services](xref:Connecting_your_DataMiner_System_to_the_cloud).

## Overview

This tutorial consists of the following steps:

- [Step 1: Deploy the DataMiner SLA tutorial package from the Catalog and explore its content](#step-1-deploy-the-dataminer-sla-tutorial-package-from-the-catalog-and-explore-its-content)
- [Step 2: Create and configure a new SLA](#step-2-create-and-configure-a-new-sla)
- [Step 3: Assign a customized alarm template](#step-3-assign-a-customized-alarm-template)
- [Step 4: View and analyze SLA metrics](#step-4-view-and-analyze-sla-metrics)

## Step 1: Deploy the 'DataMiner SLA tutorial' package from the Catalog and explore its content

1. Go to <https://catalog.dataminer.services/details/ac72d9e5-4c12-4408-a591-2fc2316abebf>.

1. Deploy the catalog item to your DataMiner Agent by clicking the *Deploy* button.

   > [!TIP]
   > See also: [Deploying a Catalog item to your system](xref:Deploying_a_catalog_item)

1. Open DataMiner Cube and check that the following items are created in your DataMiner agent:
    1. View: "DataMiner SLA tutorial"
    1. Element: "Power Monitoring - Miami"
    1. Service: "Power Service - South Beach"

   If this is the case, the package has been successfully deployed.

   On the *Data* > *Table* page of the element, you will see that the *Street Overview* and *Power Parameters* tables contain pre-provisioned data:

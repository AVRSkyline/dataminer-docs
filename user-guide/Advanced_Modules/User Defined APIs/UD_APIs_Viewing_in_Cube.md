# Viewing APIs and tokens in DataMiner Cube

> [!WARNING]
> This feature is in preview and is not fully released yet. For now, it should only be used on a staging platform. It should not be used in a production environment.

From DataMiner 10.4.0/10.3.6 onwards, you can view an overview of your APIs and tokens in DataMiner Cube.

To do so, go to *System Center* > *User-Defined APIs*.

> [!NOTE]
> This UI is only available if the soft-launch option *UserDefinableAPI* is set to true. See [soft-launch options](xref:SoftLaunchOptions).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you were previously using the *APIDeployment* soft-launch option, keep in mind that the *User-Defined APIs* tab will replace the obsolete *API deployment* tab in the future. Make sure to move your old APIs from API deployment to the new feature. For information on how to create APIs from existing scripts, see [using an existing script page](xref:UD_APIs_Using_existing_scripts).

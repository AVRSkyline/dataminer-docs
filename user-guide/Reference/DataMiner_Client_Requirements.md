> When you connect to DataMiner using HTTPS, TLS 1.0 is required to install Cube. It is also possible to use TLS 1.1 or TLS 1.2, but in that case Microsoft .NET Framework 4.6.2 is required.

### Microsoft ASP.NET

From DataMiner 10.3.0 [CU12]/10.4.0/10.4.3 onwards<!--RN 37969-->, the [Microsoft ASP.NET 8.0 Hosting Bundle](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-aspnetcore-8.0.1-windows-hosting-bundle-installer) is required to ensure access to all requisite security updates.

> [!NOTE]
> From DataMiner 10.3.0 [CU12]/10.4.0/10.4.3 onwards, the [*VerifyDotNetVersion* prerequisite](xref:Verify_ASP_Net_Version) is run during the upload phase of a DataMiner upgrade.

### Skyline certificates

To install the Skyline certificates:

1. Depending on your setup, go to either of the following URLs, replacing [DMA] with the IP address or name of the DataMiner Agent:

   - http://[DMA]/tools

   - https://[DMA]/tools

1. Under *DataMiner Tools*, click *Register Skyline Certificates*, and then click *Run*.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Running this tool is an optional security precaution.
> - The tool will try to install the certificates for all users of the computer. If this is not possible because of insufficient rights, it will try to install the certificates for the current user only.
> - When the installation is complete, a message "Certificates have been installed (current user)" or "Certificates have been installed (all users)" will be displayed.
> - This tool (SLRegCerts.exe) also supports a "/silent" option that suppresses any message box output, so that it can be used in automatic installations.

### Optional software

**Microsoft Visio (Standard or Professional, version 2013 or later)**:

Optional software, only to be installed for users who will be creating or adapting Microsoft Visio drawings.

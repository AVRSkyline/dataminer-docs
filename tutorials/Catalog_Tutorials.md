# Catalog tutorials

As part of dataminer.services, the Catalog module allows DataMiner users and DataMiner Strategic Partners to browse and deploy available DataMiner connectors, packages, Visio drawings, Automation scripts, dashboards, and more.

Using the [Catalog Registration API](xref:Register_Catalog_Item), new Catalog items can be made available in the Catalog.

The dataminer.services platform gets updated continuously. This change log can help you trace when specific features and changes have become available in 2025.

> [!NOTE]

### 9 January 2025 - Enhancement - Remote Access performance and stability improvements [ID 41897]

Several enhancements were made to improve performance and stability for all remote access features with immediate effect.

In addition, dataminer.services now supports the creation of multiple connections instead of one by CloudGateway version 2.17.0 or higher, to increase throughput and stability even further. CloudGateway will be able to benefit from this change as soon as the 2.17.0 version is released (expected soon).

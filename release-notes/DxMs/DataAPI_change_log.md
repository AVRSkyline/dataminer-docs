A new endpoint has been added to the DataAPI DxM that allows to perform configurations.

Currently it supports:

#### 05 March 2024 - Enhancement - DataAPI 1.1.0 - Upgrade to .NET8 [ID_39022]

Data API has now been upgraded to use .NET8 instead of .NET6. This means .NET 8 Runtime now has to be installed in order to run Data API.

#### 05 March 2024 - Enhancement - DataAPI 1.0.2 - Upgrade WiX Installer to version 4.0.4 [ID_38981]

Data API Installer has now been upgraded to use WiX version 4.0.4.

#### 02 March 2024 - Fix - DataAPI 1.0.1 - Add DataMiner icon to application [ID_38839]

DataMiner icon has been added to the DxM and will now appear as Application icon if you view it Task Manager or similar.

#### 31 January 2024 - New Feature - DataAPI 1.0.0 - New DataAPI module [ID_36542] [ID_36588] [ID_36575] [ID_37055] [ID_37311] [ID_37337] [ID_37648] [ID_37796] [ID_37817] [ID_37837] [ID_37897] [ID_37898] [ID_38088] [ID_38159] [ID_38570]

A new Data API module is now available as a DxM (DataMiner Extension Module).

It provides an HTTP API with the purpose of ingesting data into DataMiner. 
Within the HTTP body of the request a JSON-formatted structure with key-value pairs can be provided.

Data API will then, according to the provided JSON data, dynamically generate connectors with the corresponding standalone parameters, table, and columns.

##### Client Libraries [ID_36542]

The API consists of a HTTP web API and client libraries are generated to facilitate the usage.
At the present time C# and Python are supported (other languages can use the HTTP API calls).

##### API Gateway module registration [ID_36575] [ID_37055] [ID_38570]

Data API will now register itself with API Gateway allowing for an overview of all node instances.

##### Decimals calculation for numeric parameters [ID_37337]

Data API will calculate an appropriate number of decimals to use with numeric parameters based on the precision of the value provided upon creation of the parameter.

##### Auto-generated connector parameters [ID_37648] [ID_37837]

Parameters generated by Data API will use IDs within the range of 10 Million (inclusive) to 11 Million (exclusive).

They will be all be saved and trended by default. Additionally, a trend template will be created and updated as new parameters are added.

##### Limit the size of API request [ID_37817]

Requests for Data API must remain under 1MB in size otherwise they will be rejected and will not be parsed.

##### Installation and setup

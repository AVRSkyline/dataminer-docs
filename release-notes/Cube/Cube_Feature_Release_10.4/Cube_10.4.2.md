#### DataMiner Cube: Problem when adding up [Start Time:] placeholders [ID_37661]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU22]/10.3.0 [CU11] - FR 10.4.2 -->

When the [Sum:] placeholder was used to add [Start Time:] placeholders, in some cases, the sum would not be correct.

From now on, when configuring [Start Time:] placeholders that will be used in Sum operations, a format will have to be specified.

## Changes

### Enhancements

#### Optimization of memory handling when closing cards [ID_37858]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU22]/10.3.0 [CU11] - FR 10.4.2 -->

Overall memory handling when closing cards has been optimized.

#### Alarm Console: All alarms tabs listing suggestion events now have the 'Automatically remove cleared alarms' option enabled by default [ID_38034]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU22]/10.3.0 [CU11] - FR 10.4.2 -->

From now on, all alarm tabs listing suggestion events will behave like alarm tabs listing active alarms, i.e. the *Automatically remove cleared alarms* option will be enabled by default, except for alarm tabs listing historical alarms or information events.

### Fixes

#### Problem when adding up [Start Time:] placeholders [ID_37661]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU22]/10.3.0 [CU11] - FR 10.4.2 -->

When the [Sum:] placeholder was used to add [Start Time:] placeholders, in some cases, the sum would not be correct.

From now on, when configuring [Start Time:] placeholders that will be used in Sum operations, a format will have to be specified.

#### Problem when right-clicking after selecting a large number of elements and/or services in a view card [ID_37981]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU22]/10.3.0 [CU11] - FR 10.4.2 -->

When, in a view card, you selected a large number of elements and/or services and then right-clicked, in some cases, Cube could become unresponsive.

#### Correlation: Problem with 'Dynamic' option in 'Send email' action [ID_37995]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU22]/10.3.0 [CU11] - FR 10.4.2 -->

When configuring a Correlation rule, you can make that rule send an email by adding a *Send email* action to it.

In some cases, when you opened a *Send email* action, it would incorrectly not be possible to select the *Dynamic* option to indicate that the elements that triggered the Correlation rule have to be included.

#### Visual Overview: Problem with user permissions when right-clicking a visual overview linked to a service [ID_38018]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU22]/10.3.0 [CU11]/10.4.0 [CU0] - FR 10.4.2 -->

When, in DataMiner Cube, you right-clicked inside a visual overview linked to a service, the context menu would incorrectly allow you to edit the visual overview when you had permission to edit services in general but no permission to edit that specific service.

From now on, when you right-click inside a visual overview linked to a service, the context menu will only allow you to edit the visual overview when you have permission to edit that specific service (on top of the permission to edit services in general and the permission to access and edit visual overviews).

#### System Center: 'Clean up unused' tool would incorrectly consider custom Visio files assigned to elements as unused [ID_38061]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU22]/10.3.0 [CU11]/10.4.0 [CU0] - FR 10.4.2 -->

In *System Center*, you can clean up unused Visio files. However, up to now, this *Clean up unused Visio files* tool would incorrectly consider custom Visio files assigned to elements as unused.

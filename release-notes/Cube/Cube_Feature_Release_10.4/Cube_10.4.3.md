## Changes

### Enhancements

#### System Center: Database setting "CloudStorage" renamed to "STaaS" [ID_38325]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU22]/10.3.0 [CU12]/10.4.0 [CU0] - FR 10.4.3 -->

In the *Database* section of *System Center*, up to now, when a DataMiner Agent was configured to use Storage as a Service (STaaS), the *Database* setting was set to "CloudStorage". This "CloudStorage" value has now been renamed to "STaaS".

Also, when *Database* is set to "STaaS", the *Configuration* and *Maintenance* sections will no longer be visible in both the *General* and *Offload* tabs, and the *Cassandra preparation/migration* button will be hidden.

### Fixes

#### User menu: Problem when logging out immediately after logging in [ID_38178]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU22]/10.3.0 [CU12]/10.4.0 [CU0] - FR 10.4.3 -->

When you logged out of Cube immediately after logging in, in some cases, a blank home screen would appear instead of the login screen.

From now on, the *Sign out* button will only be enabled once the login screen has been loaded.

#### No longer allowed to create properties with a name that consists of whitespace characters only [ID_38209]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU22]/10.3.0 [CU12]/10.4.0 [CU0] - FR 10.4.3 -->

Up to now, DataMiner Cube would incorrectly allow you to create properties of which the name consisted of whitespace characters only. From now on, this is no longer allowed.

#### DataMiner Cube was not able to reconnect to the server after a disconnect using gRPC [ID_38261]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU22]/10.3.0 [CU11]/10.4.0 [CU0] - FR 10.4.2 -->

Up to now, when using a gRPC connection, Cube was not able to verify whether the server endpoint was available. As a result, it would fail to reconnect to the server when the connection had been lost and would display a `Waiting for the connection to become available...` message indefinitely.

#### Correlation: Apply button would not be enabled when a correlation rule had been modified [ID_38351]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU22]/10.3.0 [CU12]/10.4.0 [CU0] - FR 10.4.3 -->

When changes had been made to a correlation rule, in some cases, the Apply button would incorrectly not be enabled.

Also, the *Limit the base alarms* option will now be properly validated.

#### Problem when opening a service card [ID_38354]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU22]/10.3.0 [CU12]/10.4.0 [CU0] - FR 10.4.3 -->

When you opened a service card, in some rare cases, an `InvalidOperationException` could be thrown.

#### Problem when opening a service card of which the default page was set to 'Reports' [ID_38380]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU22]/10.3.0 [CU12]/10.4.0 [CU0] - FR 10.4.3 -->

When you opened a service card of which the default page was set to *Reports*, an error could occur, causing DataMiner Cube to become unresponsive.

#### Alarm Console: Reports view button would not be shown [ID_38398]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU22]/10.3.0 [CU12]/10.4.0 [CU0] - FR 10.4.3 -->

On undocked alarm cards or alarm consoles that were embedded in e.g. elements cards, in some cases, the reports view button would incorrectly not be shown.

#### Visual Overview: Parsing problem when using a custom separator inside a [param:] placeholder [ID_38405]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU22]/10.3.0 [CU12]/10.4.0 [CU0] - FR 10.4.3 -->

When a custom separator was used inside a [param:] placeholder referring to a table parameter value, the retrieved value would not be parsed correctly.

#### Automation: Problem when selecting 'User interaction' in the 'Add action' box [ID_38406]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU22]/10.3.0 [CU12]/10.4.0 [CU0] - FR 10.4.3 -->

When, while creating or editing an Automation script, you opened the *Add action* selection box and selected "User interaction", in some cases, an exception could be thrown.

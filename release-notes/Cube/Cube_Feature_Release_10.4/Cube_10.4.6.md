### Enhancements

#### System Center: Certain sections will no longer be visible when connected to a DaaS system [ID_39173]

When DataMiner Cube is connected to a DaaS system, in *System Center*, the following sections will no longer be visible:

- *Database > General*
- *Backup*
- *Search & Indexing > Indexing engine*
- *System settings > Time to live*
- *Tools > Query executer*

Also, when DataMiner Cube is connected to a DaaS system, the *Indexing* app will no longer be visible, even when the *Indexing* soft-launch option is enabled.

#### Alarm Console: Enhanced performance when loading a large number of alarms in an active alarms tab [ID_39235] [ID_39236]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 - FR 10.4.6 -->

Because of a number of enhancements, overall performance has increased when loading a large number of alarms into an active alarm tab.

#### Visual Overview: Enhanced performance when processing conditions based on view names, service names or element names [ID_39241]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU15] / 10.4.0 [CU3] - FR 10.4.6 -->

Because of a number of enhancements, overall performance has increased when processing conditions based on view names, service names or element names.

#### Alarm Console: Enhanced performance when retrieving the side panel data after selecting an alarm [ID_39284]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU15] / 10.4.0 [CU3] - FR 10.4.6 -->

For each alarm tab, you can open a side panel in the Alarm Console showing the real-time value and history of a selected alarm.

Because of a number of enhancements, overall performance has now increased when retrieving this side panel data after selecting an alarm.

### Fixes

#### Spectrum monitors: Parameter positions would incorrectly be reused [ID_39225]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU15] / 10.4.0 [CU3] - FR 10.4.6 -->

When, while editing a spectrum monitor, you clicked *Group parameters* to ungroup all parameters, the parameter positions would incorrectly be reused when multiple parameters and multiple measurement points from the same monitor script were being used.

From now on, when you click *Group parameters* to ungroup all parameters, the parameter positions will no longer be reused.

#### Problem when opening a card [ID_39251]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU15] / 10.4.0 [CU3] - FR 10.4.6 -->

When you opened a card, in some cases, the data on the card would not get loaded. As a result, the card would remain empty.

#### Visual Overview: Problem with placeholder value update detection [ID_39325]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU15] / 10.4.0 [CU3] - FR 10.4.6 -->

In some cases, the algorithm that had to detect placeholder value updates would work incorrectly. When a placeholder value had been changed, it would incorrectly not report a value change, and when a placeholder value had not been changed, it would incorrectly report a value change.

## Changes

### Enhancements

#### Enhanced performance when starting up DataMiner Cube [ID 40373]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU20] / 10.4.0 [CU8] - FR 10.4.11 -->

Up to now, all DCF interface data would be retrieved by default each time you started DataMiner Cube. From now on, this data will only be retrieved when needed. As a result, overall performance has increased when starting up DataMiner Cube.

### Fixes

#### Services: Alarm color of a service card page would be incorrect when the service contained a partially included table of an element [ID 40597]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU20] / 10.4.0 [CU8] - FR 10.4.11 -->

When you opened the card of a service that contained only part of a table of an element, in some cases, the alarm color of the card page would  incorrectly reflect the alarm state of the entire table instead of the consolidated alarm state of the included rows.

## Changes

### Enhancements

#### Alarm Console: Newly opened suggestion events tab will now include 'Service impact', 'Services' and 'RCA level' columns by default [ID_38732]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU14]/10.4.0 [CU2] - FR 10.4.5 -->

From now on, a newly opened suggestion events tab will include *Service impact*, *Services* and *RCA level* columns by default.

Also, from now on, when you right-click a column header and select *Add/Remove column > Set default columns* in a suggestion events tab, the default columns will be restored correctly. Up to now, selecting the *Set default columns* menu option would incorrectly restore the default columns of an active alarms tab instead.

### Fixes

*No fixes have been added yet.*

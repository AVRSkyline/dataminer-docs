## New features

#### Interactive Automation scripts: New option to skip the confirmation window when aborting [ID 40720]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 - FR 10.4.12 -->

DataMiner Cube now supports the new `SkipAbortConfirmation` property that was added to `UIBuilder`. When this property is set to true, the confirmation window will not be displayed when the interactive Automation script is aborted. By default, this property will be set to false.

#### Specifying a different layout for each of the four Cube sides [ID 40887]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU21] / 10.4.0 [CU9] - FR 10.4.12 -->

On each of the four Cube sides, it is now possible to specify a different layout.

## Changes

### Enhancements

#### System Center - Logging: 'Resource Manager Scheduler' log file now available in DataMiner tab [ID 40899]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU20] / 10.4.0 [CU8] - FR 10.4.11 -->

In the *Logging* section of *System Center*, the following log file can now also be consulted in the *DataMiner* tab:

- Resource Manager Scheduler

#### Label "Show Agent alarms" now translated [ID 40868]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU21] / 10.4.0 [CU9] - FR 10.4.12 -->

If you view the Cube UI in one of the supported languages other than English, the label "Show Agent alarms" will now be translated to the selected language.

This label is used in the *Agent alarms* section of the *System Center > Agents > Manage* page.

#### Router Control: Link added to 'Dynamic table filter syntax' page in dataminer.docs [ID 40959]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU21] / 10.4.0 [CU9] - FR 10.4.12 -->

In the Router Control module, it is possible to add a matrix represented by two table parameters, i.e. an input and an output table, instead of a matrix parameter. To do so, in the *Add matrix* dialog box, a specific filter syntax needs to be used in the *Advanced configuration* section. In that section, you can now find a link to the [Dynamic table filter syntax](xref:Dynamic_table_filter_syntax) page in dataminer.docs.

### Fixes

#### Problem when a large number of objects were added to, updated in or removed from a view [ID 40791]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU21] / 10.4.0 [CU9] - FR 10.4.12 -->

In some cases, the Cube UI could start to behave erratically when a large number of objects were added to, updated in or removed from a view.

#### Visual Overview - Resource Manager component: SelectedPool variable could get set incorrectly when selecting a booking on a resource band [ID 40845]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU21] / 10.4.0 [CU9] - FR 10.4.12 -->

When, in a *Resource Manager* component, you selected a booking on a resource band of which the resource was filtered by ID, the *SelectedPool* variable could get set incorrectly.

#### License expiration window: Title and text included the incorrectly spelled word "licence" [ID 40894]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU21] / 10.4.0 [CU9] - FR 10.4.12 -->

When a license has expired, a notification window will appear when you open DataMiner Cube.

Up to now, both the title and the text of that notification window would include the incorrectly spelled word "licence". This word has now been changed to "license".

#### Desktop app start window: Message 'Did you mean ...?' would incorrectly be displayed when you entered the name of a non-existing DMS [ID 40896]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU21] / 10.4.0 [CU9] - FR 10.4.12 -->

When, in the start window of the Cube desktop app, you clicked the '+' button and entered the name of a non-existing DataMiner System in the *Host* box, up to now, two messages would appear:

- "Not a DataMiner Agent", and
- "Did you mean", followed by the exact name you entered.

This last message will no longer be displayed.

#### Trending: Viewport of trend graph would incorrectly jump to the last day [ID 40931]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU21] / 10.4.0 [CU9] - FR 10.4.12 -->

When you opened a trend graph, in some rare cases, its viewport would incorrectly jump to the last day.

#### No longer possible to open web apps from within Cube [ID 40951]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU21] / 10.4.0 [CU9] - FR 10.4.12 -->

In some cases, when you used Cube to connect to the DataMiner Agent running on the same machine with *Connecting type* set to "Auto", due to a hostname resolution issue, it was no longer possible to open web apps like Monitoring or Dashboards from within Cube. Also, the name of the DataMiner System would no longer be displayed in the Cube header.

#### System Center: Problem when opening the 'Permissions > Views' tab of a user group [ID 40969]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU21] / 10.4.0 [CU9] - FR 10.4.12 -->

When, in *System Center*, you opened the *Permissions > Views* tab of a particular user group, in some cases, Cube could become unresponsive when that tab contained a large amount of items.

#### Elements: 'Force unlock element' would incorrectly appear instead of 'Unlock element' after locking an element [ID 40994]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU21] / 10.4.0 [CU9] - FR 10.4.12 -->

When you locked an element by clicking *Lock element* in the hamburger menu of the element card, in some cases, the *Force unlock element* command would incorrectly appear instead of the *Unlock element* command.

#### Alarm Console - Behavioral anomaly detection: Problem when selecting 'Improve alarm template' after giving a downward trend change a 'thumbs up' [ID 41006]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU21] / 10.4.0 [CU9] - FR 10.4.12 -->

When you gave a downward trend change a "thumbs up" and then selected *Improve alarm template*, the pop-up window that appeared would incorrectly not show the button needed to switch between the proposed configuration and the current configuration for downward trend changes.

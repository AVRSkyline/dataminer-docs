## New features

#### Interactive Automation scripts: New option to skip the confirmation window when aborting [ID 40720]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 - FR 10.4.12 -->

DataMiner Cube now supports the new `SkipAbortConfirmation` property that was added to `UIBuilder`. When this property is set to true, the confirmation window will not be displayed when the interactive Automation script is aborted. By default, this property will be set to false.

## Changes

### Enhancements

#### System Center - Logging: 'Resource Manager Scheduler' log file now available in DataMiner tab [ID 40899]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU20] / 10.4.0 [CU8] - FR 10.4.11 -->

In the *Logging* section of *System Center*, the following log file can now also be consulted in the *DataMiner* tab:

- Resource Manager Scheduler

#### Label "Show Agent alarms" now translated [ID 40868]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU21] / 10.4.0 [CU9] - FR 10.4.12 -->

If you view the Cube UI in one of the supported languages other than English, the label "Show Agent alarms" will now be translated to the selected language.

This label is used in the *Agent alarms* section of the *System Center > Agents > Manage* page.

### Fixes

#### Problem when a large number of objects were added to, updated in or removed from a view [ID 40791]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU21] / 10.4.0 [CU9] - FR 10.4.12 -->

In some cases, the Cube UI could start to behave erratically when a large number of objects were added to, updated in or removed from a view.

#### Visual Overview - Resource Manager component: SelectedPool variable could get set incorrectly when selecting a booking on a resource band [ID 40845]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU21] / 10.4.0 [CU9] - FR 10.4.12 -->

When, in a *Resource Manager* component, you selected a booking on a resource band, in some cases, the *SelectedPool* variable could get set incorrectly.

#### License expiration window: Title and text included the incorrectly spelled word "licence" [ID 40894]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU21] / 10.4.0 [CU9] - FR 10.4.12 -->

When a license has expired, a notification window will appear when you open DataMiner Cube.

Up to now, both the title and the text of that notification window would include the incorrectly spelled word "licence". This word has now been changed to "license".

#### Desktop app start window: Message 'Did you mean ...?' would incorrectly be displayed when you entered the name of a non-existing DMS [ID 40896]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU21] / 10.4.0 [CU9] - FR 10.4.12 -->

When, in the start window of the Cube desktop app, you clicked the '+' button and entered the name of a non-existing DataMiner System in the *Host* box, up to now, two messages would appear:

- "Not a DataMiner Agent", and
- "Did you mean", followed by the exact name you entered.

This last message will no longer be displayed.

## Changes

### Enhancements

#### Visual Overview: Support for dynamic values in AlarmFilter shape data value [ID_40228]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU19] / 10.4.0 [CU7] - FR 10.4.10 -->

In the AlarmFilter shape data value, dynamic values (e.g. session variables) are now supported.

#### Trending: Enhanced requirements check before displaying the relation learning light bulb in the top-right corner of a trend graph [ID_40396]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU19] / 10.4.0 [CU7] - FR 10.4.10 -->

Before it displays the relation learning light bulb in the top-right corner of a trend graph, DataMiner Cube has to perform a requirements check.

During that requirements check, up to now, it would use the *GetCCAGatewayGlobalStateRequest* message to check whether the DataMiner System is connected to dataminer.services. From now on, it will use the new *IsCloudConnected* message instead.

### Fixes

#### False-positive warning log entry when Services or Profiles module was opened [ID_40385]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU19] / 10.4.0 [CU7] - FR 10.4.10 -->

When the Services or Profiles module was opened in Cube, a false-positive warning entry could be added to the Cube logging, with the following message:

```txt
Profile and Services - The visio file name was empty or null. Check the response message from the server
```

#### Problem when logging on to a DataMiner System that required an additional logon through a portal [ID_40387]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU19] / 10.4.0 [CU7] - FR 10.4.10 -->

When you tried to log on via DataMiner Cube to a DataMiner System that required an additional logon through a portal, up to now, the logon would fail because an incorrect response would be passed on to the server. From now on, the correct response will be passed on.

#### Visual Overview: Shapes with ButtonState data would fail to hide as expected [ID_40454]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU19] / 10.4.0 [CU7] - FR 10.4.10 -->

Shapes with *ButtonState* data would fail to hide as expected.

#### Services: Problem when trying to edit a service that had been edited previously [ID_40493]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU19] / 10.4.0 [CU7] - FR 10.4.10 -->

When, while editing a service, you added an element or another service to that service and applied the changes, it would no longer be possible to edit the service again. When you tried to do so, the service card would be empty.

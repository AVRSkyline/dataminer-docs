### Fixes

#### Alarm Console : Problem when a correlation/incident alarm got cleared [ID_37231]

<!-- 10.2.0 [CU20]/MR 10.3.0 [CU8] - FR 10.3.11 -->

On a system with a large number of correlation/incident alarms, in some cases, an error could occur when one of those alarms was cleared. That alarm would then incorrectly remain visible in the Alarm Console.

#### DataMiner Cube - Trending: Problem with Y axis labels on trend graphs showing data from string and non-string parameters [ID_37281]

<!-- 10.2.0 [CU20]/MR 10.3.0 [CU8] - FR 10.3.11 -->

When you opened a trend graph showing trend data of a parameter of type string, and you added another, non-string parameter to that same graph, the Y axis of the newly added parameter would not be rendered correctly. The labels would be placed too close to each other, making them unreadable.

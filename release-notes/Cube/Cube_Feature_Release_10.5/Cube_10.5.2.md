## Changes

### Enhancements

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU11] / 10.5.0 [CU0] - FR 10.5.2 -->

### Fixes

#### Alarm Console: Problem when an alarm tab and an AlarmSummary shape were being loaded simultaneously [ID 41484]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU11] / 10.5.0 [CU0] - FR 10.5.2 -->

When, in the Alarm Console, an alarm tab was being loaded while, at the same time, a Visio shape containing a data field of type *AlarmSummary* was being loaded, in some cases, an exception could be thrown.

#### Protocols & templates: Problem when an update was received from the DMA while you were navigating through the app [ID 41494]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU11] / 10.5.0 [CU0] - FR 10.5.2 -->

When, in the *Protocols & templates* app, you had selected a protocol, a protocol version and a template in order to check the list of assigned elements, up to now, other items could incorrectly get selected when an update unrelated to any of the items you selected was received from the DataMiner Agent to which you were connected.

#### Parameter-specific template editor would not load the correct template data for a non-table parameter of a DVE child element [ID 41510]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU11] / 10.5.0 [CU0] - FR 10.5.2 -->

When you opened a parameter-specific alarm, trend or information template editor for a non-table parameter in a DVE child element (which is a table parameter in the DVE parent element), up to now, the template data would not get loaded correctly.

#### Visual Overview: Problem with counter showing the number of masked alarms when an AlarmSummary shape was linked to all alarms [ID 41513]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU11] / 10.5.0 [CU0] - FR 10.5.2 -->

When you had linked an *AlarmSummary* shape to all alarms (i.e. active alarms, masked alarms and information events) by adding a data field of type *AlarmSummary* set to "all", the counter showing the number of masked alarms in the shape text (i.e. "#Masked") would show an incorrect number of alarms.

#### DataMiner Cube desktop app would not open when started from the DataMiner Taskbar Utility [ID 41556]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU11] / 10.5.0 [CU0] - FR 10.5.2 -->

When you tried to open the DataMiner Cube desktop app from the DataMiner Taskbar Utility by selecting *Launch > DataMiner Cube*, the DataMiner Cube icon would appear in the system tray, but the app would incorrectly not be started.

#### Alarm Console: Cleared base alarm would incorrectly not be removed from an incident alarm [ID 41562]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU11] / 10.5.0 [CU0] - FR 10.5.2 -->

When one of the base alarms of an incident alarm got cleared, in some cases, the incident alarm would incorrectly still show the cleared alarm as a base alarm.

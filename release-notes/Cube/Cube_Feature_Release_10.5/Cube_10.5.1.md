## Changes

### Enhancements

#### System Center - Users/Groups: Tooltip of 'Admin tools' permission has been enhanced [ID 40983]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU10] / 10.5.0 [CU0] - FR 10.5.1 -->

When you hover over the information icon next to the *Modules > System configuration > Tools > Admin tools* user permission, a tooltip appears, showing more information on this permission. The text of this tooltip has now been enhanced.

#### System Center - Agents: Clustering compatibility checks will now be performed by the DMA to which Cube is connected [ID 41049]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU10] / 10.5.0 [CU0] - FR 10.5.1 -->

When you try to add a DataMiner Agent to the DataMiner System, a number of checks will be performed to determine whether the new Agent is compatible to be added. Up to now, these compatibility checks would be performed by Cube. From now on, they will be performed by the DataMiner Agent to which Cube is connected.

#### DataMiner Cube now support alarm tree IDs when processing correlation and incident alarms [ID 41156]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU10] / 10.5.0 [CU0] - FR 10.5.1 -->

DataMiner Cube now supports the newly introduced alarm tree IDs when processing correlation and incident alarms.

#### Cards: Enhancements to prevent view cards from showing a 'Loading' message when opened [ID 41162]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU22] / 10.4.0 [CU10] - FR 10.5.1 -->

A number of enhancements have been made to prevent view cards from showing a "Loading" message when opened.

#### Alarm templates: Text in 'Augmented Operations alarm settings' pop-up window has been made more translation-friendly [ID 41254]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU10] / 10.5.0 [CU0] - FR 10.5.1 -->

In the *Augmented Operations alarm settings* pop-up window, the text has been adjusted to allow a more natural translation to other languages.

#### Client compatibility framework: Baseline updated [ID 41276]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU10] / 10.5.0 [CU0] - FR 10.5.1 -->

To make sure a Cube client is backwards compatible with all servers it connects to, it is necessary for that client to know which features a server is aware of. Therefore, when a Cube client connects to a particular server, that server will return a list of features it supports.

However, to prevent these feature lists from getting too large, a feature baseline is set on a regular basis. This will allow a server to only return features that have been added or modified since a particular version. Now, the baseline has been updated to DataMiner version 10.4.12.

#### Redundancy groups: Configuration enhancements [ID 41315]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU10] / 10.5.0 [CU0] - FR 10.5.1 -->

A number of enhancements have been made with regard to the configuration of redundancy groups and redundancy group templates:

- When a block is loading in the *Switching detection* section, a "Loading" message will now be displayed on top of that block, making it impossible to make changes to the settings in that block until all settings have been loaded.

- The blocks in the *Switching detection* section will now initially be in an error state instead of a valid state. This will prevent users from saving an invalid configuration when data is still being loaded or when certain blocks contain invalid or corrupted data.

- More validation checks will now be done when scanning the changes made to the configuration. The outcome of those checks will determine whether the Apply button get enabled or not.

- When a validation scan detects invalid data, an entry will be added to the SLClient server logging. However, that entry will only be visible in the Logging module when the *Show debug logging* option is enabled. Also, in that case, no update message will be sent to the server. The user will receive a message saying that a problem occurred and that more details can be found in the Logging module.

#### Correlation & Scheduler apps - 'Send email' action: Attached dashboard will be shown in red when it no longer exists [ID 41364]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU10] / 10.5.0 [CU0] - FR 10.5.1 -->

When, in the *Correlation* app or the *Scheduler* app, you open an existing *Send email* action to which a dashboard is attached, from now on, that dashboard will be shown in red when it no longer exists.

### Fixes

#### Visual Overview: Shape data values starting with '[property:' and ending with ']' would be parsed incorrectly [ID 41047]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU10] / 10.5.0 [CU0] - FR 10.5.1 -->

When a shape linked to an element or a view contained shape data of which the value started with "[property:" and ended with "]", up to now, the entire value would be interpreted as a property, even when it included other types of placeholders.

#### Connection object would leak memory when you logged out of DataMiner Cube [ID 41103]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU10] / 10.5.0 [CU0] - FR 10.5.1 -->

When you logged out of DataMiner Cube, the connection object would leak memory.

#### Resources app: Quarantine warning would always appear when something went wrong while adding or updating a resource [ID 41201]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU22] / 10.4.0 [CU10] - FR 10.5.1 -->

When, in the *Resources* app, you added or updated a resource, up to now, a pop-up window showing a quarantine warning would appear whenever something went wrong.

From now on, a pop-up window showing a quarantine warning will only appear in cases where quarantine applies.

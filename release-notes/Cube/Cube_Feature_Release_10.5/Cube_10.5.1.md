### Enhancements

#### Cards: Enhancements to prevent view cards from showing a 'Loading' message when opened [ID 41162]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU22] / 10.4.0 [CU10] - FR 10.5.1 -->

A number of enhancements have been made to prevent view cards from showing a "Loading" message when opened.

#### Alarm templates: Text in 'Augmented Operations alarm settings' pop-up window has been made more translation-friendly [ID 41254]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU10] / 10.5.0 [CU0] - FR 10.5.1 -->

In the *Augmented Operations alarm settings* pop-up window, the text has been adjusted to allow a more natural translation to other languages.

### Fixes

#### Resources app: Quarantine warning would always appear when something went wrong while adding or updating a resource [ID 41201]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU22] / 10.4.0 [CU10] - FR 10.5.1 -->

When, in the *Resources* app, you added or updated a resource, up to now, a pop-up window showing a quarantine warning would appear whenever something went wrong.

From now on, a pop-up window showing a quarantine warning will only appear in cases where quarantine applies.

## Changes

### Enhancements

#### CISCO CBR-8 CCAP Platform: Improved bit rate calculations for interfaces [ID_39687]

In the CISCO CBR-8 CCAP Platform connector, the efficiency and accuracy of the bit rate calculation for interfaces has been improved.

### Fixes

#### Overlapping GUI elements on PNM thresholds configuration page [ID_39723]

Previously, on the *Configuration* > *Thresholds Settings* > *PNM* page of the EPM visual overview, GUI elements could overlap when a threshold was modified. The spacing on this page has been adjusted to prevent this issue.

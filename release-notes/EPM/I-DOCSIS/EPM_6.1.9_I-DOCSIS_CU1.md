# EPM 6.1.9 I-DOCSIS CU1

## Enhancements

#### DOCSIS version information streamlined [ID_38078]

To streamline the way DOCSIS version information is displayed, a number of changes have been implemented:

- On the visual overview pages for all levels, the *Number DOCSIS 1.X* parameter has been added. 
- The *DOCSIS Other* parameter has been renamed to *DOCSIS Unknown* and added to all data and visual overview pages for all levels.
- In the CM dashboard, the names of the Latency, Max Jitter, and Average Packet Loss parameters were changed, and the order of the PNM KPIs, group delay, reflection status, and reflection distance were adjusted.
- The font size in the visual overview for the CM has been adjusted so that it is the same for every KPI.
-

### Enhancements

#### APIGateway now runs on .NET 8 and allows you to enable kernel response buffering [ID_38710]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU14] / 10.4.0 [CU2] - FR 10.4.5 -->

APIGateway has been upgraded. It now runs on Microsoft .NET 8.

This service now allows you to enable kernel response buffering, which should improve throughput and responsiveness over high-latency connections. This setting is disabled by default. To enable it, do the following:

1. In the `C:\Program Files\Skyline Communications\DataMiner APIGateway\` folder of the DataMiner Agent, create a JSON file named *appsettings.custom.json*.
1. Open this JSON file, and add the following content:

   ```json
   { "HostingOptions": { "EnableKernelResponseBuffering": true } }
   ```

#### New SLTimeToLive.txt log file containing all changes made to the TTL settings [ID_38851]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU14] / 10.4.0 [CU2] - FR 10.4.5 -->

In the `C:\Skyline DataMiner\Logging\SLTimeToLive` folder, you can now find a new *SLTimeToLive.txt* log file, listing all changes made to the TTL settings in Cube's *System Center > System settings > Time to live* page.

> [!NOTE]
> The contents of this folder will not be deleted during either a DataMiner restart or a DataMiner upgrade. However, in the *SLTimeToLive.txt* file, the oldest entries will be removed when the maximum log file size is exceeded.

#### Security enhancements [ID_37345] [ID_38904]

<!-- RN 37345: MR 10.3.0 [CU14] - FR 10.3.11 -->
<!-- RN 38904: MR 10.3.0 [CU14] / 10.4.0 [CU2] - FR 10.4.5 -->

A number of security enhancements have been made.

#### Protocols: Enhanced performance when filling an array using the QActionTableRow objects in a QAction [ID_39017]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU14] / 10.4.0 [CU2] - FR 10.4.5 -->

Because of a number of enhancements, overall performance has increased when filling an array using the `QActionTableRow` objects in a QAction.

### Fixes

#### Databases: Problem when starting a migration from MySQL to Cassandra [ID_37589]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU14] / 10.4.0 [CU2] - FR 10.4.1 -->

When you started a migrating from a MySQL database to a Cassandra database, an error could occur when the connection to the MySQL database took a long time to get established.

#### Automatic incident tracking: Incomplete or empty alarm groups after DataMiner startup [ID_38441]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU14] / 10.4.0 [CU2] - FR 10.4.5 -->

After a DataMiner startup, in some cases, certain alarm groups would either be incomplete or empty due to missing remote base alarms.

#### Not possible to delete a service created via an SRM booking when it had been assigned a name that was already being used [ID_38914]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU14] / 10.4.0 [CU2] - FR 10.4.5 -->

When a service created via an SRM booking got into an error state because it had been assigned a name that was already being used by another object, it would not be possible to delete it as it would be considered invalid.

#### Service & Resource Management: Problem when the function manager was not able to read the functions.xml file in C:\\Skyline DataMiner\\ServiceManager [ID_38925]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU14] / 10.4.0 [CU2] - FR 10.4.5 -->

Up to now, in some cases, a run-time error could occur when the function manager was not able to read the *functions.xml* file in `C:\Skyline DataMiner\ServiceManager`.

From now on, if an error occurs when the function manager was not able to read that file, an entry will be added to the *SLFunctionManager.txt* log file, and if the error occurred because the file was locked by another process, the log entry will include the name of the process.

#### Problem with SLProtocol due to incorrect redundant connection [ID_39114]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU14] / 10.4.0 [CU2] - FR 10.4.4 [CU0] -->

The redundant polling feature allows SLProtocol to select another connection when the main connection goes into a timeout.

In some cases, when SLProtocol selected a connection with a type different from that of the main connection, an error could occur. From now on, when SLProtocol has to select another connection when the main connection goes into a timeout, it will only take into account connections with a type equal to that of the main connection.

#### Visual Overview: 'Connection could not be fully established' error when viewing visual overviews in a web app [ID_39133]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU14] / 10.4.0 [CU2] - FR 10.4.5 -->

When you opened a visual overview in a web app, in some cases, a `Connection could not be fully established` error would appear.

#### No emails could be sent as long as SLASPConnection was not fully initialized [ID_39137]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU14] / 10.4.0 [CU2] - FR 10.4.5 -->

Up to now, an error would occur when a DataMiner module (e.g. Automation, Scheduler, etc.) tried to send an email while *SLASPConnection* was still initializing. From now on, all DataMiner modules will be able to send emails, even when *SLASPConnection* is still initializing.

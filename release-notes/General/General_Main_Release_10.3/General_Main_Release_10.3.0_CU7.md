### Enhancements

#### Updated bookings now only set to Confirmed when necessary [ID_36818]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU7] - FR 10.3.10 -->

Up to now, bookings were always set to Confirmed again when they were updated, even though this is not always necessary. As such, bookings will now only be set to Confirmed again when this is actually needed, i.e.:

- When the new status of the booking is not the same as the old status.
- When the start or end time is no longer the same.
- When the resources in the booking have changed.
- when the enhanced service profile ID has changed.

### Fixes

#### DataMiner upgrade failed because prerequisites check incorrectly marked Agent as failed [ID_36776]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU19]/10.3.0 [CU7] - FR 10.3.10 -->

In some cases, it could occur that the prerequisites check that is performed at the start of a DataMiner upgrade incorrectly marked an Agent as failed, which caused the upgrade to fail.

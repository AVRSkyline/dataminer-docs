### Enhancements

#### New BPA test 'Check Cluster SLNet Connections' [ID_37110]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU10] - FR 10.4.1 -->

When run on a particular agent in a DataMiner System, this new BPA test will trigger a local test on each agent in the DMS that will

- check the connections between the different DMAs and between the DMAs in Failover setups, and
- report any communication problems.

For more information, see [Check Cluster SLNet Connections](xref:BPA_Check_Cluster_SLNet_Connections).

#### Security enhancements [ID_37641]

<!-- 37641: MR 10.2.0 [CU22]/10.3.0 [CU10] - FR 10.4.1 -->

A number of security enhancements have been made.

#### SLAnalytics - Behavioral anomaly detection: Flatline suggestion events will now automatically be cleared after a set amount of time [ID_37716]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU10] - FR 10.4.1 -->

Similar to other types of anomaly suggestion events, flatline suggestion events will now also be cleared automatically after a set amount of time.

> [!NOTE]
> Flatline alarms stay open until the flatline in question disappears or SLAnalytics is restarted.

### Fixes

#### DELT: Trend data missing in DELT package after exporting tables with primary keys of type string [ID_37664]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU10] - FR 10.4.1 -->

When you exported tables of which the primary keys were of type string, the DELT export package would incorrectly not contain any trend data.

#### Attempt to update a deleted service would incorrectly cause that service to re-appear [ID_37679]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU10] - FR 10.4.1 -->

In some rare cases, an attempt would incorrectly be made to update a service that had already been deleted, causing that service to re-appear.

Additional logging has now been added to allow better tracing of errors that occur while creating or updating services.

#### Problem with remote clients after restarting a DMA in a gRPC-only cluster [ID_37726]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU10] - FR 10.4.1 -->

When a DataMiner System was configured to use gRPC connections only (i.e. when *EnableDotNetRemoting* was set to false on all agents), in some cases, remote clients would not get properly registered with SLDataMiner after restarting a DataMiner Agent. This would cause remote requests to fail if they had to be handled by SLDataMiner on the DataMiner Agent that was restarted.

#### SLAnalytics: Problem when the alarm repository was not available at startup [ID_37782]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU22]/10.3.0 [CU10] - FR 10.4.1 -->

In some cases, an error could occur in SLAnalytics when it was not able to connect to the alarm repository at startup.

#### Entire SNMPv3 response would be discarded when one or more cells contained 'no such instance' [ID_37815]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU22]/10.3.0 [CU10] - FR 10.4.1 -->

When a table was polled via SNMPv3 and the response included a cell that contained *no such instance*, the table would not get populated with the values that were received. Instead, the entire result set would be discarded.

### Enhancements

#### Security enhancements [ID_36294]

<!-- 36294: MR 10.3.0 [CU5] - FR 10.3.8 -->

A number of security enhancements have been made.

#### Service & Resource Management: Enhanced performance of GetEligibleResources call [ID_36430]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU5] - FR 10.3.8 -->

Because of a number of enhancements, overall performance of the *GetEligibleResources* call has increased.

#### DataMiner Agents joining a cluster will now synchronize their ProtocolScripts\DllImport folder [ID_36494]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU17]/10.3.0 [CU5] - FR 10.3.8 -->

When a DataMiner Agent joins a cluster, it will now synchronize its `ProtocolScripts\DllImport` folder.

Also, when processing a protocol, a DataMiner Agent will now synchronize

- the files in the `ProtocolScripts/DllImport` folder, and
- the files in the folders mentioned in the *QAction@dllImport* attribute.

#### Stream Viewer will now display parameter IDs in decimal format instead of octal format [ID_36525]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU17]/10.3.0 [CU5] - FR 10.3.8 -->

Stream Viewer will display an error message when an SNMP poll group contained either an invalid parameter or a parameter that did not have its SNMP setting enabled.

Up to now, that error message would contain the ID of the parameter in octal format. From now on, it will contain the ID of the parameter in decimal format instead.

#### Factory reset tool will no longer try to delete non-existing folders [ID_36550]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU17]/10.3.0 [CU5] - FR 10.3.8 -->

Up to now, the factory reset tool *SLReset.exe* would log an exception each time it had tried to delete a non-existing folder. From now on, when it has to delete a folder, it will first check whether that folder exists. If not, it will not try to delete it.

### Fixes

#### SLAnalytics: Incorrect trend predictions in case of incorrect data ranges set in the protocol [ID_36521]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU17]/10.3.0 [CU5] - FR 10.3.8 -->

If, in the protocol, a data range is specified for a parameters for which trend data prediction is required, the trend prediction algorithm will cap the prediction values to the data range. For example, if a parameter has a rangeLow value equal to 0 and a rangeHigh value equal to 100, the prediction will not contain values lower than 0 or higher than 100.

From now on, if the trend data contains values outside of the specified data range, the trend prediction algorithm will no longer consider the data range values to be valid or reliable, and will not limit the prediction to this range.

### Fixes

#### SLLogCollector: 'Access is denied' errors [ID_39364]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU17]/10.4.0 [CU5] - FR 10.4.8 -->

In some cases, SLLogCollector would not have the required permissions to access process objects or execute certain WMI queries. As a result, `Access is denied` errors would be added to the *SLLogCollector.txt* log file.

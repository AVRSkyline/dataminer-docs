### Enhancements

#### Caching of protocol signature information will enhance overall performance during a DataMiner startup [ID_39468]

<!-- MR MR 10.3.0 [CU19]/10.4.0 [CU7] - FR 10.4.7 -->

Information regarding protocol signature validation will now be cached. This will considerably enhance overall performance during a DataMiner startup.

### Fixes

#### Problem in SLDataMiner when redundancy groups were configured to switch based on connectivity [ID_40118]

<!-- 10.3.0 [CU19]/10.4.0 [CU7] - FR 10.4.10 -->

When redundancy groups were configured to switch based on connectivity, it could occur that the signals sent to SLDataMiner contained duplicates. In a system with a heavy load, this could cause too many of these to be sent, which would cause a memory leak in the SLDataMiner process and eventually caused the process to crash.

Performance improvements have now been implemented to avoid sending duplicate signals and to better process the signals. A throttling mechanism has also been implemented: in case SLDataMiner detects that too many signals are being sent, the DCF calculation will be slowed down to allow the system to catch up. In the logging, this will be mentioned in *SLConnectivity.txt* like in the example below:

```txt

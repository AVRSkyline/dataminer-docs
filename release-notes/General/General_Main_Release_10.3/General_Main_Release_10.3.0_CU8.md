### Enhancements

*No enhancements have been added to this release yet.*

### Fixes

#### NATS connection could fail due to payloads being too large [ID_36427]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU8] - FR 10.3.8 -->

In some cases, the NATS connection could fail due to payloads being too large. As a result, parameter updates and alarms would no longer be saved to the database.

#### Not all Protocol.Params.Param.Interprete.Others tags would not be read out [ID_36797]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU20]/10.3.0 [CU8] - FR 10.3.11 -->

Not all [Protocol.Params.Param.Interprete.Others](xref:Protocol.Params.Param.Interprete.Others) tags would not be read out, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

#### Inventory & Asset Management: Problem when synchronizing between the DMA and the database [ID_37177]

<!-- 10.2.0 [CU20]/MR 10.3.0 [CU8] - FR 10.3.11 -->

The Asset Manager would add NullReference exceptions to the SLNet log file when trying to synchronize between the DMA and the database.

When a view or an element was deleted on the DMA before a synchronization was performed from the database to the DMA, the deleted items would not get recreated unless the DMA had been restarted before the synchronization, and when a mediation configuration file was adapted and reloaded, the view configuration would not be reloaded.

#### SLElement could read and write to the same memory blocks on different threads [ID_37180]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU8] - FR 10.3.11 -->

In some cases, SLElement could read and write to the same memory blocks on different threads, causing a serialized parameter update to get into a corrupt state.

### Fixes

#### Creating or updating a function resource while its parent element was in an error state would incorrectly be allowed [ID_35963]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU15]/10.3.0 [CU3] - FR 10.3.6 -->

When you created or updated a function resource while its parent element was in an error state, up to now, the state of that parent element would not be checked correctly. As a result, adding or updating the function resource would incorrectly be allowed.

From now on, when you create or update a function resource while its parent element is in an error state, an error will be thrown.

#### GQI: New 'ThenSort by' query node allows sorting by multiple columns [ID_35807] [ID_35834]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.5 -->

To make sorting more intuitive, the new *ThenSort by* node can now be used in combination with the *Sort* node, which has now been renamed to *Sort by*.

Up to now, all sorting had to be configured by means of *Sort* nodes. For example, if you wanted to first sort by column A and then by column B, you had to create a query in the following counter-intuitive way:

1. Data source
1. Sort by B
1. Sort by A

or

1. Query X (i.e. Data Source, sorted by B)
1. Sort by A

From now on, you can create a query in a much more intuitive way. For example, if you want to first sort by column A and then by column B, you can now create a query in the following way:

1. Data source
1. Sort by A
1. Then sort by B

Note that, from now on, every *Sort by* node will nullify any preceding *Sort by* node. For example, in the following query, the *Sort by B* node will be nullified by the *Sort by A* node, meaning that the result set will only be sorted by column A.

1. Data source
1. Sort by B
1. Sort by A

> [!NOTE]
> The behavior of existing queries (using e.g. *Sort by B* followed by *Sort by A*) will not be altered in any way. Their syntax will automatically be adapted when they are migrated to the most recent GQI version.
> For example, an existing query using *Sort by B* followed by *Sort by A* will use *Sort by A* followed by *Then sort by B* after being migrated.

#### GQI: Data source rows now have a unique key [ID_35999]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.5 -->

GQI data source rows now have an internal key. This key is unique (per data source) and cannot be null or empty.

> [!NOTE]
> At present, you can only interact with these keys in [ad hoc data sources](#ad-hoc-data-source-keys) and [custom GQI operators](#custom-gqi-operator-keys).

##### Ad hoc data source keys

The `GQIRow` class has a new string property named `Key`. The key of a newly created row in an ad hoc data source can be specified using the following constructor:

```csharp
GQIRow(string key, GQICell[] cells)
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Although this constructor will throw an exception when a key is null or empty, the author of the data source is responsible for making sure that keys are unique.
> - If you don't pass the `key` argument when creating a row, the row index will be used as key.

##### Custom GQI operator keys

The `GQIEditableRow` class has a new string property named `Key`.

At present, this property can only be used to access the row key of an existing row. Keys of custom GQI operators cannot be modified yet.

##### Built-in data source keys

All rows of built-in data sources will automatically be assigned a unique key based on the row index.

##### Join operator keys

When two rows are joined, the key of the joined row will be a concatenation of the left row key and the right row key, separated by a forward slash:

```txt
<left-key>/<right-key>
```

In case of a left, right or outer join, when there is no match, either the left or right key will be an empty string. This is the reason why row keys cannot be empty. By allowing empty row keys we would risk creating duplicate keys each time rows are joined.

> [!NOTE]
> In keys of joined rows, any forward slashes and backward slashes will be escaped:
>
> - Any forward slash within the left or right key will be escaped by a backslash: `/` will become `\/`
> - Any backslash within the left or right key will be escaped by a second backslash: `\` will become `\\`

##### Aggregation operator keys

When no grouping is involved, the single row resulting from an aggregation operation will have a static row key equal to "0".

When grouping is involved, the single row resulting from an aggregation operation will have a key that is the concatenation of all the group values, separated by forward slashes.

For example, in case of the following query ...

`Data source -> Aggregate -> Group by A -> Group by B -> Group by C`

... the resulting row keys will look like this ...

```txt
<group-value-a>/<group-value-b>/<group-value-c>
```

In order to avoid duplicate group keys when there is only a single *Group By* operation, any empty values will be replaced by a single forward slash.

Also, any slashes in the group values will be escaped before they are joined. For more information about escaping slashes, see [Join operator keys](#join-operator-keys).

## Changes

### Enhancements

#### SLNetClientTest: New DOM-related features [ID_35550]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.5 -->

In the *SLNetClientTest* tool, the following new DOM-related features have been made available:

- Viewing a JSON representation of a selected ModuleSettings configuration.

- Completely remove a DOM Manager from the system.

  > [!NOTE]
  >
  > - When you instruct the *SLNetClientTest* tool to delete a DOM Manager, it will count the number of DOM instances. If the DOM Manager in question contains more than 10,000 DOM instances, an error message will appear, saying that deleting the DOM Manager would take too long.

  > - When you instruct the *SLNetClientTest* tool to delete a DOM Manager, it will not remove the indices from the Elasticsearch database. These indices have to be deleted manually. If you do not delete them manually, we recommend to not re-use the module ID as this could cause configuration conflicts.

> [!CAUTION]
> Always be extremely careful when using this tool, as it can have far-reaching consequences on the functionality of your DataMiner System.

#### Security enhancements [ID_35668] [ID_35997]

<!-- 35668: MR 10.2.0 [CU14]/10.3.0 [CU2] - FR 10.3.5 -->
<!-- 35997: MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.5 -->

A number of security enhancements have been made.

#### SLAnalytics: A message will be added to the SLAnalytics.txt log file when no Cassandra database is present [ID_35748]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.5 -->

Up to now, SLAnalytics would stop working without giving any notice whatsoever when it was started on a system without a Cassandra database.

From now on, when no Cassandra database is present, SLAnalytics will be stopped gracefully and a message will be added to the *SLAnalytics.txt* log file.

#### Alarms generated when a database goes in offload mode will now have severity 'Notice' instead of 'Critical' [ID_35749]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU14]/10.3.0 [CU2] - FR 10.3.5 -->

When a database went in offload mode, up to now, an alarm with severity *Critical* was generated. From now on, an alarm of severity *Notice* will be generated instead.

#### SLNetClientTest: More user-friendly pop-up window will now appear when connecting to a DMA that uses external authentication via SAML [ID_35755]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.5 -->

When, in the SLNetClientTest tool, you connected to a DataMiner Agent that used external authentication via SAML, up to now, a pop-up window showing the authentication URL would prompt you to enter the SAML response string. From now on, a pop-up window similar to the one used in Cube will appear instead.

> [!CAUTION]
> Always be extremely careful when using this tool, as it can have far-reaching consequences on the functionality of your DataMiner System.

#### GQI: Raw datetime values retrieved from Elasticsearch will now be converted to UTC [ID_35784]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.5 -->
<!-- Not added to MR 10.4.0 -->

Up to now, after each step in a GQI query, raw datetime values were always converted to the time zone that was specified in the query options. From now on, raw datetime values retrieved from Elasticsearch will be converted to UTC instead. The time zone specified in the query options will now only be used when converting a raw datetime value to a display value.

#### SLAnalytics will no longer disregard first-time alarm template assignments [ID_35794]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU2] - FR 10.3.5 -->

Up to now, SLAnalytics only took into account changes to alarm templates that were already assigned to elements and disregarded first-time alarm template assignments.

From now on, SLAnalytics will also take into account first-time alarm template assignments.

#### Business Intelligence: Enhancements with regard to the retrieval of data from logger tables and to general error handling [ID_35820]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU13]/10.3.0 [CU2] - FR 10.3.5 -->

A number of enhancements have been made to the Business Intelligence module, especially with regard to the retrieval of data from logger tables and to general error handling.

#### DataMiner Storage Module: Installer enhancements [ID_35842]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.5 -->
<!-- Not added to MR 10.4.0 -->

A number of enhancements have been made to the DataMiner Storage Module installer.

#### SLAnalytics: Enhanced performance [ID_35871]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU2] - FR 10.3.5 -->

Overall performance of SLAnalytics has increased because of a number of enhancements made to its caching mechanism.

#### SLAnalytics - Behavioral anomaly detection: Events associated with a DVE child element will no longer be linked to the DVE parent element [ID_35901]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.5 -->

Up to now, when an event associated with a DVE child element was generated, internally, that event would be linked to the DVE parent element. From now on, it will be linked to the child element instead.

#### GQI data sources that require an Elasticsearch database will now use GetInfoMessage(InfoType.Database) to check whether Elasticsearch is available [ID_35907]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU14]/10.3.0 [CU2] - FR 10.3.5 -->

Up to now, GQI data sources that require an Elasticsearch database used the `DatabaseStateRequest<ElasticsearchState>` message to check whether Elasticsearch was available. From now on, they will use the `GetInfoMessage(InfoType.Database)` message instead.

#### Improved error handling when elements go into an error state [ID_35944]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU14]/10.3.0 [CU2] - FR 10.3.5 -->

When an element goes into an error state after an attempt to activate it failed, from now on, no more calls to SLProtocol, SLElement or SLSpectrum will be made for that element.

Also, when an element that generates DVE child elements or virtual functions goes into an error state, from now on, the generated DVE child elements or virtual functions will also go into an error state. However, in order to avoid too many alarms to be generated, only one alarm (for the main element) will be generated.

The following issues have also been fixed:

- When a DVE parent element in an error state on DataMiner startup was activated, its DVE child elements or virtual functions would not be properly loaded.

- When a DVE parent element was started, the method that has to make sure that ElementInfo and ElementData are in sync would incorrectly not check all child elements.

### Fixes

#### SLLogCollector: Problem when collecting multiple memory dumps with the 'Now and when memory increases with X Mb' option [ID_35617]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU14]/10.3.0 [CU2] - FR 10.3.5 -->

When the *SLLogCollector* tool had to collect memory dumps of multiple processes with the *Now and when memory increases with X Mb* option, it would incorrectly only collect the memory dump of the first process that reached the specified Mb limit.

From now on, it will collect at least the "now" dump for each of the selected processes.

#### NATS would incorrectly be re-installed when a WMI query error occurred while the NATS installer was being run at DMA startup [ID_35647]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU14]/10.3.0 [CU2] - FR 10.3.5 -->

When the NATS installer was being run at DMA startup, in some cases, due to an issue with a WMI query, NATS could incorrectly be re-installed, even though NATS and NAS were already running.

From now on, the execution of the NATS installer at DMA startup will be skipped when NATS is already running. Also, if an error occurs when running a WMI query during the execution of the NATS installer, a message saying that the re-installation has failed will be added to the *SLUMSEndpointManager.txt* log file.

> [!NOTE]
> When an error occurs while running a WMI query, and no NATS/NAS service is running, NATS will not be installed automatically. A manual installation of NATS will be needed.

#### Existing masked alarms would incorrectly affect the overall alarm severity of an element [ID_35678]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU14]/10.3.0 [CU2] - FR 10.3.5 -->

Existing masked alarms would incorrectly affect the overall alarm severity of an element.

#### Failover: Offline agent would incorrectly try to take a backup of the Elasticsearch database [ID_35721]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU14]/10.3.0 [CU2] - FR 10.3.5 -->

When, in Failover setups, you configure a DataMiner backup on the online agent, the same backup will also be scheduled on the offline agent, and if these setups have a clustered Elasticsearch database, a backup of that database cluster will be included in the DataMiner backup.

In Failover setups where both agents included a local Elasticsearch database that was part of an Elasticsearch cluster, the online agent would fail to take a backup of the Elasticsearch databases due to a backup in progress, triggered earlier by the offline agent.

From now on, only the online agent will be allowed to take a backup of the Elasticsearch database, and the offline agent will log the following entry:

```txt
Elastic backup will not be taken - Only active agents from a failover pair can take the backup.
```

#### DateTime instances would not get serialized correctly when an SLNet connection supported protocol buffer serialization [ID_35777]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.5 -->

When an SLNet connection supported protocol buffer serialization, DateTime instances would not get serialized correctly.

#### GQI: GetArgumentValue method would throw an exception when used to access the value of an optional argument [ID_35783]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.5 -->

When the `GetArgumentValue<T>(string name)` method was used in an ad hoc data source or a custom operator script to access the value of an optional argument that had not been passed, the following exception would be thrown:

```txt
Could not find argument with name '{argument.Name}'.
```

#### SLProtocol would interpret signed numbers incorrectly [ID_35796]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU14]/10.3.0 [CU2] - FR 10.3.5 -->

SLProtocol would interpret signed numbers incorrectly, causing parameters to display incorrect values.

#### Problem with SLNet when serializing a ModelHost error [ID_35802]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU2] - FR 10.3.5 -->

An SLNet error could occur when serializing a ModelHost error.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> BREAKING CHANGE: To fix this issue, the `Exception` field had to be removed from the `ManagerStoreError` class.

#### SLAnalytics: Flatline events on child DVE elements would incorrectly be cleared automatically [ID_35818]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU2] - FR 10.3.5 -->

Events generated after detecting change points of type "flatline" in trend data of child DVE elements would incorrectly be cleared automatically.

#### SLAnalytics - Behavioral anomaly detection: Every parameter included in an alarm template would incorrectly be considered a monitored parameter [ID_35832]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU2] - FR 10.3.5 -->

SLAnalytics would incorrectly consider every parameter included in an alarm template to be a monitored parameter, even it is was not being monitored.

#### DataMiner Maps: Markers could disappear when a layer was enabled or disabled [ID_35838]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU14]/10.3.0 [CU2] - FR 10.3.5 -->

In some cases, markers could disappear when a layer was enabled or disabled.

#### SLAnalytics could keep on waiting indefinitely for large delete operations to finish [ID_35848]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU13]/10.3.0 [CU2] - FR 10.3.5 -->

In some cases, SLAnalytics could keep on waiting indefinitely for large delete operations to finish.

#### Business Intelligence: At SLA startup, the active alarms would no longer be in sync with the actual alarms affecting the SLA [ID_35862]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU14]/10.3.0 [CU2] - FR 10.3.5 -->

At SLA startup, in some cases, the active alarms would no longer be in sync with the actual alarms affecting the SLA.

Also, a number of other minor fixes with regard to SLA management have been implemented.

#### Problem when processing BPA test output [ID_35891]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.5 -->
<!-- Not added to MR 10.4.0 -->

Each time the *SLLogCollector* tool is run, since DataMiner version 10.3.3, it orders the *Standalone BPA Executor* tool to execute all BPA tests available in the system and store the results in the `C:\Skyline DataMiner\Logging\WatchDog\Reports\Pending Reports` folder.

In some cases, it would not be possible to process the output of some of those tests due to formatting issues.

#### Problem when an SLA element was stopped or deleted while a parameter that triggered a QAction of the SLA in question was being updated [ID_35892]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU14]/10.3.0 [CU2] - FR 10.3.5 -->

An error could occur when an SLA element was stopped or deleted while a parameter that triggered a QAction of the SLA in question was being updated.

#### DataMinerException thrown the first time an InfoData message was deserialized [ID_35897]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU2] - FR 10.3.5 -->

The first time a message with an object of a type that inherited from `InfoData` was sent from SLNet to a client, the following DataMinerException was thrown when the message was deserialized:

```txt
Skyline.DataMiner.Net.Exceptions.DataMinerException: Failed to deserialize message (ProtoBuf). Possible version incompatibility between client and server.  ---&gt; System.InvalidOperationException: It was not possible to prepare a serializer for: Skyline.DataMiner.Net.InfoData ---&gt; System.InvalidOperationException: Unable to resolve a suitable Add method for System.Collections.Generic.IReadOnlyList`1[[System.Guid, mscorlib, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089]]&#xD;
```

#### Problem with SLElement when a timed action was stopped [ID_35928]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU2] - FR 10.3.5 -->

In some rare cases, an error could occur in SLElement when a timed action was stopped.

#### Business Intelligence: Outage correction would incorrectly be increased when a history alarm affected the outage [ID_35942]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.5 -->

When a history alarm affected a closed outage to which a correction had been applied, the correction would incorrectly be increased. From now on, the correction will be left untouched.

#### SNMP: OIDs with a leading dot would incorrectly no longer be allowed [ID_35954]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU14]/10.3.0 [CU2] - FR 10.3.5 -->

OIDs with a leading dot would incorrectly no longer be allowed. From now on, OIDs with a leading dot are allowed again.

#### NT Notify type NT_GET_BITRATE_DELTA would not return a valid value for a table with a single row [ID_35967]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU14]/10.3.0 [CU2] - FR 10.3.5 -->

In some rare cases, NT Notify type NT_GET_BITRATE_DELTA (269), which retrieves the time between two consecutive executions of the specified SNMP group (in ms), would not return a valid value for a table with a single row.

#### 'SLA Affecting' property of cleared or re-opened alarm would incorrectly contain 'Y' instead of 'Yes' [ID_35987]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU14]/10.3.0 [CU2] - FR 10.3.5 -->

When an alarm was cleared and re-opened for the same parameter or parameter key combination, its *SLA Affecting* property would incorrectly contain "Y" instead of "Yes".

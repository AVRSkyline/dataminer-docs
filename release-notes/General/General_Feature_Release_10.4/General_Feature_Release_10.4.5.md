## Changes

### Enhancements

#### Service & Resource Management: Enhanced performance of volume license check [ID_38705]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU2] - FR 10.4.5 -->

Because of a number of enhancements, overall performance has increased when performing volume license checks.

#### APIGateway now runs on .NET 8 and allows you to enable kernel response buffering [ID_38710]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU14] / 10.4.0 [CU2] - FR 10.4.5 -->

APIGateway has been upgraded. It now runs on Microsoft .NET 8.

This service now allows you to enable kernel response buffering, which should improve throughput and responsiveness over high-latency connections. This setting is disabled by default. To enable it, do the following:

1. In the `C:\Program Files\Skyline Communications\DataMiner APIGateway\` folder of the DataMiner Agent, create a JSON file named *appsettings.custom.json*.
1. Open this JSON file, and add the following content:

   ```json
   { "HostingOptions": { "EnableKernelResponseBuffering": true } }
   ```

#### Enhanced performance when starting up a DataMiner Agent with a large number of virtual elements [ID_38780]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU2] - FR 10.4.5 -->

Because of a number of enhancements, overall performance has increased when starting up a DataMiner Agent with a large number of virtual elements.

#### Security enhancements [ID_38904]

### Fixes

#### Problem with user accounts [ID_38182]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU2] - FR 10.4.5 -->

In some cases, user accounts could become corrupted.

Also, in some cases, SLDataMiner could stop working when an alarm template or trend template was uploaded, removed, assigned or unassigned.

#### Automatic incident tracking: Incomplete or empty alarm groups after DataMiner startup [ID_38441]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU14] / 10.4.0 [CU2] - FR 10.4.5 -->

After a DataMiner startup, in some cases, certain alarm groups would either be incomplete or empty due to missing remote base alarms.

#### GQI: Problem when loading extensions [ID_38998]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 - FR 10.4.5 -->

When GQI extensions (i.e. ad hoc data sources or custom operators) were being loaded, in some cases, an exception could be thrown when inspecting the assembly of an extension that prevented subsequent extensions from being loaded.

This type of exceptions will be now be properly caught and logged as warnings so that other extensions will no longer be prevented from being loaded.

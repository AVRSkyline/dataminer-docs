### Enhancements

#### Service & Resource Management: Booking name validation now case-insensitive [ID_38556]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU1] - FR 10.4.4 -->

The validation of the name of a booking is now case-insensitive. This means that when the SRM Framework checks if there are future bookings with the same name, the casing is now no longer taken into account.

#### SLAnalytics - Behavioral anomaly detection: Suggestion event generation will now be limited [ID_38674]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU1] - FR 10.4.4 -->

From now on, the generation of anomaly suggestion events will be limited to 50 events per hour per type of anomaly (level shift, trend change, flatline or variance change).

> [!NOTE]
> The generation of anomaly alarm events (i.e. on parameters that have anomaly monitoring configured in the alarm template) will remain unlimited.

#### GQI: Clearer error message will now be thrown when an ad hoc data source or custom operator cannot be instantiated [ID_38686]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU12] / 10.4.0 [CU1] - FR 10.4.4 -->

Up to now, when an ad hoc data source or custom operator could not be instantiated, the following exception would be thrown when an error occurred on object creation level (within the constructor):

`Error: Could not create instance of datasource when trying to use an ad hoc datasource.`

From now on, the following exception will be thrown instead:

`Error trapped: Could not create instance of datasource 'datasource ID': <exception message>.`

\* `<exception message>` being the message that was thrown within the constructor.

#### SLLogCollector will now also collect the logs of the CommunicationGateway DxM [ID_38716]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU12] / 10.4.0 [CU1] - FR 10.4.4 -->

SLLogCollector will now also collect the logs of the *CommunicationGateway* DxM.

### Fixes

#### Problem with file offload mechanism when main database is offline [ID_38542]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU12] / 10.4.0 [CU1] - FR 10.4.4 -->

When the main database is offline, file offloads are used to store write/delete operations. In some cases, this file offload mechanism could end up in an unrecoverable state due to a threading issue.

#### Problem with SLProtocol when calculating the length of a serial response [ID_38591]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU12] / 10.4.0 [CU1] - FR 10.4.4 -->

In some cases, SLProtocol could stop working due to an `Access violation reading location` error being thrown while calculating the length of a serial response.

#### SLAnalytics - Automatic incident tracking: Problem when updating alarm groups [ID_38629]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU13] / 10.4.0 [CU1] - FR 10.4.4 -->

Each time the focus score of an alarm is updated, incident tracking has to update its alarm groups. In some cases, incident tracking would incorrectly update its groups twice, causing the groups to be set to an undefined state.

#### Service & Resource Management: Booking corrupted after SRM_QuarantineHandling retrieved incorrect version of the booking [ID_38646]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU12] / 10.4.0 [CU1] - FR 10.4.4 -->

Up to now, it could occur that the script *SRM_QuarantineHandling* retrieved a previous version of a booking instead of the latest, quarantined version, which could cause subsequent updates to corrupt the booking object. To prevent this, *SRM_QuarantineHandling* will now be called after a booking is saved.

#### SLAnalytics - Behavioral anomaly detection: Problem when updating the anomaly configuration for a DVE element [ID_38661]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU1] - FR 10.4.4 -->

When you had updated the anomaly configuration for a DVE element, SLAnalytics would not process the changes correctly, causing incorrect behavioral anomaly alarms to be generated.

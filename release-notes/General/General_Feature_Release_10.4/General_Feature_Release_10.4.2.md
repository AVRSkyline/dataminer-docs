### Fixes

#### SLDataGateway: Problem with casing when retrieving data from Elasticsearch/OpenSearch [ID_37835]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU11] - FR 10.4.2 -->

When SLDataGateway retrieved data from Elasticsearch/OpenSearch on behalf of a DataMiner app (e.g. Ticketing), in some cases, it would pass an incorrect result set to that app due to a casing issue.

#### Service & Resource Management: Timeout script in end event of booking would not get executed when DMA was stopped within the time range of the booking [ID_37911]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU11] - FR 10.4.2 -->

When the end event of a booking used a timeout script, in some cases, that script would not get executed when the DataMiner Agent was stopped within the time range of the booking.

#### DataMiner Taskbar Utility: Problem when making SLTaskbarUtility perform an action using the command prompt [ID_37952]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU11] - FR 10.4.2 -->

When you made the DataMiner Taskbar Utility perform some action using the command prompt, the arguments would not be parsed correctly when no instance of SLTaskbarUtility was running.

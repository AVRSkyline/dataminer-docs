### Enhancements

#### Configuration of database offload functionality moved from DBConfiguration.xml to DB.xml [ID_37446]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.4.2 -->

Up to now, the database offload functionality described below had to be configured in the *DBConfiguration.xml* file. From now on, it has to be configured in the *DB.xml* file instead.

- **Configuring a size limit for file offloads**

  When the main database is offline, file offloads are used to store write/delete operations. You can configure a limit for the file size of these offloads. When the limit is reached, new data will be dropped.

  Example:

  ```xml
  <DataBases>
    ...
    <FileOffloadConfiguration>
      <MaxSizeMB>20</MaxSizeMB>
    </FileOffloadConfiguration>
  </DataBases>
  ```

- **Configuring multiple OpenSearch or Elasticsearch clusters**

  It is possible to have data offloaded to multiple OpenSearch or Elasticsearch clusters, i.e. one main cluster and several replicated clusters.

  Example:

  ```xml
  <DataBases>
    <!-- Reads will be handled by the ElasticCluster with the lowest priorityOrder -->
    <DataBase active="true" search="true" ID="0" priorityOrder="0" type="ElasticSearch">
      <DBServer>localhost</DBServer>
      <UID />
      <PWD>root</PWD>
      <DB>dms</DB>
      <FileOffloadIdentifier>cluster1</FileOffloadIdentifier>
    </DataBase>
    <DataBase active="true" search="true" ID="0" priorityOrder="1" type="ElasticSearch">
      <DBServer>10.11.1.44,10.11.2.44,10.11.3.44</DBServer>
      <UID />
      <PWD>root</PWD>
      <DB>dms</DB>
      <FileOffloadIdentifier>cluster2</FileOffloadIdentifier>
    </DataBase>
  </DataBases>
  ```

#### SNMPv3 responses now have a dynamic size [ID_37948]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU11] - FR 10.4.2 -->

Up to now, the size of SNMPv3 responses was limited to 16000 bytes. When larger responses were received, a timeout message would appear in StreamViewer.

From now on, the size of SNMPv3 responses will no longer be limited, meaning that the only constriction will be the maximum size of a UDP packet (i.e. 65000 bytes).

> [!NOTE]
> When sending SNMPv3 messages, the size of those messages is still limited to 16000 bytes.

#### Enhanced performance when compiling QActions in SLScripting [ID_37993]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU11] - FR 10.4.2 -->

When QActions are compiled in SLScripting, several resources need to be loaded. Up to now, those resources would be loaded for every QAction individually. From now on, they will be loaded only once and stored in a cache in order to reduce memory and CPU overhead.

Every 10 seconds, resources that have not been referenced in the last 30 seconds will be removed from the cache.

> [!NOTE]
> Uploading protocol or app packages that contain different versions of DLL files stored in the same location may not compile against the shipped version if the previous version was also uploaded and put in use in the previous 60 seconds. Forcing a recompilation of the QActions a minute later (causing the packages to be uploaded again) will yield the expected result.
>
> Protocols and scripts should use NuGet packages as much as possible. The DLL files in those packages will then automatically be placed in folders by version. When protocols use custom non-NuGet DLL files, those should also be placed in folders by version.
>
> With DLL files such as NewtonSoft, which protocols do not reference using NuGet, overwriting the DLL file with a newer version will cause protocols with QActions that have already been compiled to no longer work after a DataMiner restart as the correct strong-named assembly can no longer be found.

#### GQI - 'Get parameter table by ID' data source: Enhanced sorting [ID_38039]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.4.2 -->

When multiple, separate sort operators were optimized by the GQI data source *Get parameter table by ID*, up to now, they would be incorrectly combined into a single multi-level sort operation. From now on, only the last sort operator will be used, consistent with the behavior in case the sort operators are not optimized.

For example, from now on, when you sort by A and, later on in the GQI query, sort again by B, the query will now only be sorted by B.

#### Security enhancements [ID_38040]

<!-- 38040: MR 10.3.0 [CU11] - FR 10.4.2 -->

A number of security enhancements have been made.

#### NATS: All nodes will now be considered primary nodes [ID_38089]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU11] - FR 10.4.2 -->

From now on, there will no longer be any primary and secondary NAS configurations. All nodes will now be considered primary and will be using their local credential files.

Also, when the NATS configuration is reset, the DMS IP addresses will now be collected via the online Failover agent.

### Fixes

#### SLDataGateway: Problem with casing when retrieving data from Elasticsearch/OpenSearch [ID_37835]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU11] - FR 10.4.2 -->

When SLDataGateway retrieved data from Elasticsearch/OpenSearch on behalf of a DataMiner app (e.g. Ticketing), in some cases, it would pass an incorrect result set to that app due to a casing issue.

#### SLAnalytics: Problem with table parameter indices containing special characters [ID_37860]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.4.2 -->

Up to now, SLAnalytics would not correctly handle special characters in the table parameter indices. These characters will now be handled correctly. If parameters with indices containing special characters are trended, they will now also receive a trend prediction in the trend graph, and their behavioral change points will now be displayed.

Also, special characters in parameter indices will no longer cause errors to be logged.

#### Service & Resource Management: Timeout script in end event of booking would not get executed when the booking was set to end while the DMA was being stopped [ID_37911]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU11] - FR 10.4.2 -->

When the end event of a booking used a timeout script, in some cases, that script would not get executed when the booking was set to end while the DataMiner Agent was being stopped.

#### DataMiner Taskbar Utility: Problem when making SLTaskbarUtility perform an action using the command prompt [ID_37952]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU11] - FR 10.4.2 -->

When you made the DataMiner Taskbar Utility perform some action using the command prompt, the arguments would not be parsed correctly when no instance of SLTaskbarUtility was running.

#### SLDataGateway would incorrectly keep waiting for acknowledgements from SLDataGatewayAPI [ID_37985]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU11] - FR 10.4.2 -->

SLDataGateway would incorrectly keep waiting for an acknowledgement from SLDataGatewayAPI, causing numerous `Waiting for SLDataGatewayAPI to acknowledge ...` entries to be added to the *SLDataGateway.txt* log file.

#### Problem with SLProtocol when a parameter was updated while an SLA window was changing [ID_37990]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU11] - FR 10.4.2 -->

When one of the following parameters was updated while an SLA window was changing, a run-time error could occur in SLProtocol:

- Base timestamp
- Monitor span
- Window size
- Window unit
- Window type
- Validity start
- Validity end

#### SLNet prefetcher would request the web API URL too often [ID_38012]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.4.2 -->
<!-- Not added to MR 10.4.0 -->

Since the legacy Reports, Dashboards and Annotations modules were disabled by default, the prefetcher in SLNet only requests the URL of the web APIs. However, up to now, it would request that URL once every second. From now on, it will only request that URL once every 10 minutes.

#### SLNet: Problem when a client application sent multiple messages to the same manager [ID_38025]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU11] - FR 10.4.2 -->

When a client application (e.g. DataMiner Cube) sent multiple messages to the same manager, in some cases, a number of those messages would return an exception and would not get processed.

#### Problem with protocol compliancies cache in SLNet [ID_38043]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU11] - FR 10.4.2 -->

The compliancies cache in SLNet, which keeps track of the minimum required version of a protocol or of whether a protocol supports Cassandra, was only refreshed when you uploaded a *protocol.xml* file that did not contain a `<Compliancies>` tag or when the cache was accessed for the first time.

#### GQI: Problem when retrieving a large amount of alarms [ID_38065]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU11] - FR 10.4.2 -->

When a GQI query had to retrieve a large amount of paged alarms, after a while, a timeout exception would be thrown even though none of the paged requests had timed out.

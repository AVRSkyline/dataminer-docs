## Changes

### Enhancements

#### Failover: Virtual IP address check will now use arp commands if ping commands are not allowed [ID_40516]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU20]/10.4.0 [CU8] - FR 10.4.11 -->

Up to now, on systems that do not allow ping commands to be executed, in some cases, the virtual IP address check would incorrectly conclude that the IP address was free and decide to claim it, causing the network interface card to malfunction due to IP addresses not being unique.

From now on, on systems that do not allow ping commands to be executed, the virtual IP address check will use arp commands instead.

### Fixes

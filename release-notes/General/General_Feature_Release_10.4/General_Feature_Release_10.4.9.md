## Changes

### Enhancements

#### SLAnalytics: Alarms and suggestion events for virtual functions will now be generated on the parent element [ID_39707]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 - FR 10.4.9 -->

When, in the scope of behavioral anomaly detection, proactive cap detection or pattern matching, SLAnalytics has to generate alarms or suggestion events for virtual functions, from now on, it will generate them on the parent element. However, it will continue to generate alarms and suggestion events for all other kinds of DVEs on the child element.

#### MessageBroker: Clients will now first attempt to connect via the local NATS node [ID_39727]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 - FR 10.4.9 -->

From now on, when a client connects to the DataMiner System, an attempt will first be made to connect to the NATs bus via the local NATS node. Only when this attempt fails, will the client connect to the NATS bus via another node.

#### Native processes will now close the MessageBroker connection immediately when stopping [ID_39863]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 - FR 10.4.9 -->

Up to now, when a native process (e.g. SLDataMiner) was stopping, in some rare cases, it would wait for 30 seconds before it closed the MessageBroker connection. From now on, it will close the MessageBroker connection immediately.

### Fixes

#### Problem with SLAnalytics while starting up [ID_39955]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 - FR 10.4.9 -->

In some rare cases, while starting up, SLAnalytics appeared to leak memory and could stop working.

#### SLNet - CloudEndpointManager: Problem at startup when NATS and NAS services were not installed [ID_39980]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU18]/10.4.0 [CU6] - FR 10.4.9 -->

At startup, in some cases, the CloudEndpointManager in SLNet could throw an exception when the NATS and NAS services were not installed.

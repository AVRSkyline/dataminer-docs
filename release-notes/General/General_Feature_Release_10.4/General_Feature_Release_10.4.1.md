## New features

#### BrokerGateway DxM will now be installed automatically during a DataMiner upgrade [ID_37714]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 - FR 10.4.1 -->

When a DataMiner Agent is upgraded to version 10.5.0/10.4.1 or above, the *BrokerGateway* DxM will automatically be installed in the `C:\Program Files\Skyline Communications\DataMiner BrokerGateway` folder.

This new DxM, which is currently still under development, is intended to manage all NATS configurations.

## Changes

### Enhancements

#### SLAnalytics - Proactive cap detection: Enhanced detection of possible future alarm threshold breaches [ID_37681]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 - FR 10.4.1 -->

When an increasing or decreasing trend is detected on a highly aggregated level (i.e. a trend that persists for more than 24 hours), from now on, a proactive cap detection suggestion event will be generated when there is a probability that the trend change in question could lead to a breach of a critical alarm limit at some point in the future, even when the breach has not yet been confirmed by the full prediction model built on the historic trend data.

#### SLAnalytics - Behavioral anomaly detection: Flatline suggestion events will now automatically be cleared after a set amount of time [ID_37716]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.4.1 -->

Similar to other types of anomaly suggestion events, flatline suggestion events will now also be cleared automatically after a set amount of time.

> [!NOTE]
> Flatline alarms stay open until the flatline in question disappears or SLAnalytics is restarted.

### Fixes

#### Databases: Problem when starting a migration from MySQL to Cassandra [ID_37589]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 - FR 10.4.1 -->

When you started a migrating from a MySQL database to a Cassandra database, an error could occur when the connection to the MySQL database took a long time to get established.

#### DELT package created on DataMiner v10.3.8 or newer could no longer be imported on DataMiner v10.3.7 or older [ID_37731]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.4.1 -->

When you exported elements via a DELT package on a DMA running DataMiner version 10.3.8 or newer, it would no longer be possible to import that DELT package on a DMA running DataMiner version 10.3.7 or older.

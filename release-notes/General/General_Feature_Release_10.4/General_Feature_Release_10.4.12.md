## New features

#### Interactive Automation scripts: New option to skip the confirmation window when aborting [ID 40683]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 - FR 10.4.12 -->

`UIBuilder` now has a new `SkipAbortConfirmation` property. When set to true, the confirmation window will not be displayed when the interactive Automation script is aborted. By default, this property will be set to false.

Example:

```csharp
UIBuilder uib = new UIBuilder();
uib.SkipAbortConfirmation = true;
```

## Changes

### Enhancements

#### OpenSearch: Enhanced performance of alarm queries [ID 40674]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU9] - FR 10.4.12 -->

Alarm filters containing brackets can now be translated to OpenSearch queries. This will considerably improve overall performance of alarm queries against OpenSearch databases.

#### Certain information events will no longer be generated when an element is duplicated [ID 40926]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 - FR 10.4.12 -->

When an element is duplicated, the following information events will no longer be generated:

- [Replicated Element]
- [Remote Element Name]
- [Remote DMA IP]

### Fixes

#### SLNet: Problem when external authentication and Windows authentication were used within the same DMS [ID 40635]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 - FR 10.4.12 -->

When, in a DataMiner System, some agents used external authentication while other agents used regular Windows authentication, in some rare cases, the SLNet error "SSPI.DLL is no longer supported" could be thrown on certain agents.

#### Problem when trying to access trend statistics on a DataMiner Cube connected via gRPC [ID 40668]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 - FR 10.4.12 -->

When DataMiner Cube was connected to a DataMiner Agent via gRPC, due to a deserialization issue on the server, it would not be possible to access trend statistics.

#### Problem when DataMiner Agent is named DATAMINER [ID 40743]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU9] - FR 10.4.12 -->

From DataMiner 10.4.0 [CU2]/10.4.5 onwards, when the computer name of a DataMiner server was DATAMINER, the server would no longer function correctly.

#### SLAnalytics - Behavioral anomaly detection: Updates to alarm templates used in alarm template groups could be disregarded [ID 40783]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU21]/10.4.0 [CU9] - FR 10.4.12 -->

Up to now, when an alarm template used in an alarm template group was updated, and no element was using that template directly, in some cases, SLAnalytics would disregard the update. This could then lead to an incorrect anomaly alarm configuration being applied to elements using the alarm template group and to incorrect focus values being set in the alarms of the elements using the alarm template group.

#### Service & Resource Management: Bookings could incorrectly be saved with a non-existing capacity parameter [ID 40808]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU9] - FR 10.4.12 -->

Up to now, a booking could incorrectly be saved with a non-existing capacity parameter of which the value was set to zero.

#### Problem with alarm severity of a service not being updated correctly [ID 40840]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU21]/10.4.0 [CU9] - FR 10.4.12 -->

In some cases, the alarm severity of a service would not be updated correctly when, during a row update, both the display key and the monitored value had been changed.

#### Failover: Problem with SLSNMPManager at startup [ID 40883]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU21]/10.4.0 [CU9] - FR 10.4.12 -->

When a DataMiner Agent that was part of a Failover setup started up, in some cases, SLSNMPManager could stop working.

#### Problem when a DVE or virtual function element was deleted while a subscription was updated [ID 40900]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU21]/10.4.0 [CU9] - FR 10.4.12 -->

When a DVE element or virtual function element was deleted while a subscription on the parent element or one of the child elements was updated, in some cases, especially when Stream Viewer was open, a run-time error could occur.

## New features

#### Interactive Automation scripts: New option to skip the confirmation window when aborting [ID 40683]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 - FR 10.4.12 -->

`UIBuilder` now has a new `SkipAbortConfirmation` property. When set to true, the confirmation window will not be displayed when the interactive Automation script is aborted. By default, this property will be set to false.

Example:

```csharp
UIBuilder uib = new UIBuilder();
uib.SkipAbortConfirmation = true;
```

## Changes

### Enhancements

#### OpenSearch: Enhanced performance of alarm queries [ID 40674]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU9] - FR 10.4.12 -->

Alarm filters containing brackets can now be translated to OpenSearch queries. This will considerably improve overall performance of alarm queries against OpenSearch databases.

### Fixes

#### Problem with alarm severity of a service not being updated correctly [ID 40840]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU21]/10.4.0 [CU9] - FR 10.4.12 -->

In some cases, the alarm severity of a service would not be updated correctly when, during a row update, both the display key and the monitored value had been changed.

#### Failover: Problem with SLSNMPManager at startup [ID 40883]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU21]/10.4.0 [CU9] - FR 10.4.12 -->

When a DataMiner Agent that was part of a Failover setup started up, in some cases, SLSNMPManager could stop working.

## New features

#### User-defined APIs: An event will now be sent when an ApiToken or ApiDefinition is created, updated or deleted [ID_39117]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 - FR 10.4.6 -->

From now on, the user-defined API manager will send out an event whenever an `ApiToken` or `ApiDefinition` object is created, update or deleted.

| Event name | Description |
|---|---|
| ApiTokenChangedEventMessage      | Generated when an [ApiToken](xref:UD_APIs_Objects_ApiToken) is created, updated, or deleted. |
| ApiDefinitionChangedEventMessage | Generated when an [ApiDefinition](xref:UD_APIs_Objects_ApiDefinition) is created, updated, or deleted. |

When subscribing to event messages, you can use the `SubscriptionFilter` to only receive the messages matching a specific filter. See the following example.

```csharp
// In this example, you will take the Connection object from the script's Engine object
var connection = engine.GetUserConnection();

// Create a random set ID that identifies our subscription
var setId = $"ApiTokenSubscription_{Guid.NewGuid()}"

// Create the filter for the ApiToken events, only enabled tokens should match
var filter = ApiTokenExposers.IsDisabled.Equal(false);
var subscriptionFilter = new SubscriptionFilter<ApiTokenChangedEventMessage, ApiToken>(filter);

// Attach a callback when a new event message arrives
connection.OnNewMessage += (sender, args) =>
{
    // Handle the events
}

// Subscribe
connection.AddSubscription(setId, subscriptionFilter);
```

#### Storage as a Service: Support for data migration towards a STaaS system using a proxy server [ID_39313]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 - FR 10.4.6 -->

As from DataMiner version 10.4.5, Storage as Service (STaaS) supports the use of a proxy server.

From now on, it is also possible to migrate data towards a STaaS system that is using a proxy server.

## Changes

### Enhancements

#### Service & Resource Management: Enhanced performance when activating function DVEs [ID_38972]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 - FR 10.4.6 -->

Because of a number of enhancements, overall performance has increased when activating function DVEs.

#### GQI: Errors related to real-time GQI data updates will now also be logged [ID_38986]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 - FR 10.4.6 -->

From now on, errors related to real-time GQI data updates will also be logged.

For example:

- When an ad hoc data source is not able to send an update due to API methods being used incorrectly.
- When a built-in data source is not able to send an update.
- When the connection used to send the updates to the client gets lost.

Exceptions associated with a custom data source will be logged in the log file of the data source in question.

#### Enhanced performance when processing changes made to service properties [ID_39011]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU15]/10.4.0 [CU3] - FR 10.4.6 -->

Because of a number of enhancements, overall performance has increased when processing changes made to service properties.

#### NATS configuration files will now use plain JSON syntax [ID_39078]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU3] - FR 10.4.6 -->

All NATS configuration files will now use plain JSON syntax.

#### Enhanced performance when logging on to a DaaS system with an older version of a DataMiner Cube client [ID_39211]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU15]/10.4.0 [CU3] - FR 10.4.6 -->

Because of a number of enhancements, overall performance has increased when logging on to a DaaS system with an older version of a DataMiner Cube client.

#### GQI: Changing the minimum log level no longer requires an SLHelper restart [ID_39309]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 - FR 10.4.6 -->

Up to now, when you changed the *serilog:minimum-level* setting in `C:\Skyline DataMiner\Files\SLHelper.exe.config`, the change would only take effect after an SLHelper restart.

From now on, when you change this setting, the change will take effect the moment you save the configuration file. Restarting SLHelper will no longer be necessary.

#### Enhanced performance when starting up a DataMiner Agent [ID_39331]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 - FR 10.4.6 -->

Because of a number of enhancements, overall performance has increased when starting up a DataMiner Agent.

#### Enhanced error message 'Failed to create one or more storages' [ID_39360]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 - FR 10.4.6 -->

When DataMiner fails to start up due to a problem that occurred while connecting to the database, a `Failed to create one or more storages` message will be thrown.

From now on, this error message will include a reference to the StorageModule log file, in which you can find more information about the problem that occurred:

`More info might be available in C:\ProgramData\Skyline Communications\DataMiner StorageModule\Logs\DataMiner StorageModule.txt.`

### Fixes

#### Automatic incident tracking: Incomplete or empty alarm groups after DataMiner startup [ID_38441]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU15]/10.4.0 [CU3] - FR 10.4.6 -->

After a DataMiner startup, in some cases, certain alarm groups would either be incomplete or empty due to missing remote base alarms.

#### Protocols: Parsing problem could lead to string values being processed incorrectly [ID_39314]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU15]/10.4.0 [CU3] - FR 10.4.6 -->

When string parameters are parsed, both an ASCII version and a Unicode version of the string value should be returned. However, up to now, when a string parameter was a table column parameter, the `Interprete` type of the table would be used. As a result, string values would be processed incorrectly.

From now on, when a table cell is saved, the `Interprete` type of the column will be used to determine whether or not it has to be processed as a string.

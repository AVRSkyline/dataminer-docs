## New features

#### DataMiner Object Models: DomInstance names now support GenericEnum fields that allow multiple values [ID_39510]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 - FR 10.4.7 -->

DomInstance names now support GenericEnum fields that allow multiple values. In other words, `list GenericEnumFieldDescriptor` will now be supported as a `FieldValueConcatenationItem` for a DomInstance name.

When you add a GenericEnumFieldDescriptor that supports multiple values to a DomDefinition NameDefinition, it will add the display names of the enum values separated by a semicolon (';').

Also, from now on, it will no longer be possible to create multiple enum values with the same values using the SLNetTypes method `AddEntry(GenericEnumEntry<T> entry)`. When you try to do so, an `InvalidOperationException` will now be thrown.

#### Factory reset tool: Additional actions [ID_39524] [ID_39530]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 - FR 10.4.7 -->

The factory reset tool `SLReset.exe` will now perform the following additional actions:

- If the DataMiner Agent is connected to *dataminer.services*, disconnect the DataMiner Agent from *dataminer.services*.
- Clear all custom appsettings of the DataMiner extension modules (DxMs).

## Changes

### Enhancements

#### GQI: Enhanced sorting of indexed logger tables [ID_38857]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 - FR 10.4.7 -->

A number of enhancements have been made with regard to the sorting of indexed logger tables.

#### Cassandra & Cassandra cluster: Enhanced performance when querying the maskstate table [ID_39192]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU16]/10.4.0 [CU4] - FR 10.4.7 -->

Because of a number of enhancements, on systems using a Cassandra and Cassandra cluster database, overall performance has increased when querying the maskstate database table. As a result, elements will start up quicker depending on the number of masked objects in the database.

#### SLDataMiner: Enhanced log entry indicating progress of multi-threaded operations that take longer that 30 seconds to complete [ID_39367]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU4] - FR 10.4.7 -->

When a multi-threaded operation takes longer that 30 seconds to complete, an entry is added to the *SLDataMiner.txt* log file to indicate that the operation in question is still in progress. This log entry has now been enhanced. It will now show the progress in more detail.

`Waiting for completion of %s : %lli/%lli completed`

#### Service & Resource Management: Enhanced performance when creating multiple bookings simultaneously [ID_39390]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU16]/10.4.0 [CU4] - FR 10.4.7 -->

Because of a number of enhancements, overall performance has increased when creating multiple bookings simultaneously.

#### DataMiner Object Models: Enhanced performance of DOM instance count queries with a DOM state filter [ID_39405]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU4] - FR 10.4.7 -->

Because of a number of enhancements, overall performance has increased when executing a DOM instance count query with a DOM state filter.

#### Caching of protocol signature information will enhance overall performance during a DataMiner startup [ID_39468]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 - FR 10.4.7 -->

Information regarding protocol signature validation will now be cached. This will considerably enhance overall performance during a DataMiner startup.

#### SLAnalytics - Behavioral anomaly detection: Enhanced rounding of anomaly threshold values & optimized linking of severities to anomaly thresholds [ID_39492]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 - FR 10.4.7 -->

In alarm templates, the rounding of anomaly threshold values has been enhanced. For example, 3.09999999999999 will now be displayed as 3.1.

Also, the mechanism used to associate severities with anomaly thresholds has been optimized.

#### SLLogCollector packages will now include nslookup output for hostnames [ID_39526]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 - FR 10.4.7 -->

From now on, SLLogCollector packages will also include the *nslookup* output for the hostname configured in

- *MaintenanceSettings.xml* (HTTPS) and/or
- *DMS.xml* (Failover).

#### SLLogCollector packages now include GQI and Web API logging [ID_39557]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 - FR 10.4.7 -->

From now on, SLLogCollector packages will also include the contents of the following folders:

- *C:\\Skyline DataMiner\\Logging\\GQI*
- *C:\\Skyline DataMiner\\Logging\\GQI\\Ad hoc data sources*
- *C:\\Skyline DataMiner\\Logging\\GQI\\Custom operators*
- *C:\\Skyline DataMiner\\Logging\\Web*

#### SLAnalytics: Enhanced alarm template monitoring [ID_39561]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU4] - FR 10.4.7 -->

When an alarm template contained multiple lines for the same parameter, each with a different filter, up to now, SLAnalytics would only take into account the lines that were being monitored. From now on, as soon as one line related to a specific parameter is being monitored, SLAnalytics will take into account all lines related to that parameter.

#### Security enhancements [ID_39611] [ID_39387]

<!-- 39611: MR 10.3.0 [CU16]/10.4.0 [CU4] - FR 10.4.7 -->
<!-- 39387: MR 10.5.0 - FR 10.4.7 -->

A number of security enhancements have been made.

### Fixes

#### Issues with user accounts [ID_39234]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU4] - FR 10.4.7 -->

In some cases, user accounts could become corrupted and group memberships could get lost.

Also, in some cases, SLDataMiner could stop working when an alarm template or trend template was uploaded, removed, assigned or unassigned.

#### SLNet: Problem when sending messages due to an issue with the protobuf serializers [ID_39275]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU16]/10.4.0 [CU4] - FR 10.4.7 -->

When SLNet sent a message, in some cases, an error could occur due to an issue with the protobuf serializers.

#### Problem with SLNet when information on hanging calls was being retrieved [ID_39373]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU16]/10.4.0 [CU4] - FR 10.4.7 -->

In some rare cases, an error could occur in SLNet when information on hanging calls was being retrieved.

#### MessageBroker: Problem when trying to read a file that was being updated by another process [ID_39408]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 - FR 10.4.7 -->

In some rare cases, an exception could be thrown when MessageBroker tried to read a file that was being updated by another process.

#### SLSNMPAgent would incorrectly interpret variable trap bindings of type 'IpAddress' as bindings of type 'OctetString' [ID_39425]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU16]/10.4.0 [CU4] - FR 10.4.7 -->

Up to now, SLSNMPAgent would incorrectly interpret variable trap bindings of type 'IpAddress' as bindings of type 'OctetString'.

#### Protocols: 'next' attribute would no longer work for SNMP parameters [ID_39430]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU16]/10.4.0 [CU4] - FR 10.4.7 -->

The `next` attribute of a parameter inside a parameter group determines the number of milliseconds DataMiner has to wait before reading the next parameter. This functionality no longer worked for SNMP parameters.

Also, when a group contained single parameters in combination with a partial table, the single parameters would incorrectly also be requested each time the next batch of rows were requested from the partial table. From now on, the single parameters will only be requested once.

> [!NOTE]
> When a `next` attribute is defined on a partial SNMP table parameter inside a parameter group, then the delay will also be applied between the batches of rows that are requested.

#### Problem when disposing an ISession with multiple subscriptions [ID_39483]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 - FR 10.4.7 -->

In some cases, an `InvalidOperationException` could be thrown when a .NET Framework host application (e.g. DataMiner Automation) disposed an ISession with multiple subscriptions without having disposed the subscriptions first.

#### Interactive Automation script was not able to continue once a lost connection was re-established [ID_39487]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU16]/10.4.0 [CU4] - FR 10.4.7 -->

When a client application lost connection while an interactive Automation script was being run, up to now, the script would stop as it was not able to continue once the connection was re-established.

From now on, when a client application loses connection while an interactive Automation script is being run, the script will continue once the connection is re-established.

#### SLAnalytics: Elements imported after being deleted earlier would incorrectly be considered deleted [ID_39566]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 - FR 10.4.7 -->

When an imported element was deleted and then imported again, up to now, SLAnalytics would incorrectly considered that element as being deleted for at least a day. As a result, it would for example not detect any change points for that element during that time frame.

From now on, when an imported element is deleted and then imported again, SLAnalytics will no longer considered that element as being deleted.

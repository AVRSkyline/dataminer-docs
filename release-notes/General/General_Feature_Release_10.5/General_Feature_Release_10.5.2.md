### Enhancements

#### Failover - Virtual IP address check: Logging of the arp command will now also include the MAC address that claimed the IP address [ID 40703]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 - FR 10.5.2 -->

Since Main Release 10.3.0 [CU20]/10.4.0 [CU8] and Feature Release 10.4.11, the virtual IP address check uses both a ping and an arp command to check whether an IP address is free.

The logging of the arp command will now also include the MAC address that claimed the IP address.

#### DataMiner upgrade packages now include the latest Visual C++ Redistributable [ID 41173]

<!-- MR 10.6.0 - FR 10.5.2 -->

All DataMiner upgrade packages now include the latest Visual C++ Redistributable.

> [!NOTE]
> From now on, after having upgraded a DataMiner Agent, the *C:\\Skyline DataMiner\\Files* and *C:\\Skyline DataMiner\\Files\\x64* folders will no longer contain any individual Visual C++ Redistributable DLL files.

#### Security enhancements [ID 41475]

<!-- 41475: MR 10.6.0 - FR 10.5.2 -->

A number of security enhancements have been made.

#### History Manager: A clearer exception will now be thrown when the History Manager API is used after the History Manager has been stopped [ID 41500]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU11] - FR 10.5.2 -->

When the History Manager API was used to perform create, update or delete operations after the History Manager had been stopped, up to now, a `NullReferenceException` would be thrown.

From now on, when the History Manager API is used after the History Manager has been stopped, the following `DataMinerException` will be thrown and logged:

`There is no known manager that can process objects for Manager X. Check if the manager has been initialized, the agent is licensed and is using the required database.`

#### Storage as a Service: Enhanced performance when updating alarm information [ID 41581]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU11] - FR 10.5.2 -->

Because of a number of enhancements, overall performance has increased when updating alarm information on STaaS systems.

### Fixes

#### Problem with SLDataMiner when deleting a connector [ID 41520]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU11] - FR 10.5.2 -->

In some rare cases, SLDataMiner could stop working when a connector was deleted immediately after an element using that connector had been deleted.

#### DataMiner Maps: Markers that did not match the alarm level filter would become visible for a split second [ID 41555]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU11] - FR 10.5.2 -->

When you zoomed to a different layer while an alarm level filter was active, in some cases, markers that did not match the filter would become visible for a split second before disappearing again.

## Changes

### Enhancements

#### Deprecated NotifyDataMiner type 'NT_CONNECTIONS_TO_REMOVE' can no longer be used [ID_37595]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 - FR 10.4.1 -->

From now on, the deprecated NotifyDataMiner type *NT_CONNECTIONS_TO_REMOVE* can no longer be used.

#### SLAnalytics - Proactive cap detection: Enhanced detection of possible future alarm threshold breaches [ID_37681]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 - FR 10.4.1 -->

When an increasing or decreasing trend is detected on a highly aggregated level (i.e. a trend that persists for more than 24 hours), from now on, a proactive cap detection suggestion event will be generated when there is a probability that the trend change in question could lead to a breach of a critical alarm limit at some point in the future, even when the breach has not yet been confirmed by the full prediction model built on the historic trend data.

#### Service & Resource Management: Enhanced performance of ResourceManagerHelper.GetResources when using the ResourceExposers.ID.Equal filter [ID_37720]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 - FR 10.4.1 -->

Because of a number of enhancements, overall performance of the `ResourceManagerHelper.GetResources` method has increased when using a `ResourceExposers.ID.Equal` filter.

Also, the performance of `TrueFilterElement<Resource>` has been improved.

#### SLAnalytics - Behavioral anomaly detection: Changes made to the anomaly configuration in an alarm template of a main DVE element will immediately be applied to all open anomaly alarm events [ID_37788]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 - FR 10.4.1 -->

When you change the anomaly configuration in an alarm template assigned to a main DVE element, from now on, the changes will immediately be applied to all open anomaly alarm events. The severity of the open alarm events will be changed to the new severity defined in the updated anomaly configuration.

### Fixes

<!-- MR 10.5.0 - FR 10.4.1 -->

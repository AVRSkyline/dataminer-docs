## Changes

### Enhancements

#### Deprecated NotifyDataMiner type 'NT_CONNECTIONS_TO_REMOVE' can no longer be used [ID_37595]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 - FR 10.4.1 -->

From now on, the deprecated NotifyDataMiner type *NT_CONNECTIONS_TO_REMOVE* can no longer be used.

#### SLAnalytics - Proactive cap detection: Enhanced detection of possible future alarm threshold breaches [ID_37681]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 - FR 10.4.1 -->

When an increasing or decreasing trend is detected on a highly aggregated level (i.e. a trend that persists for more than 24 hours), from now on, a proactive cap detection suggestion event will be generated when there is a probability that the trend change in question could lead to a breach of a critical alarm limit at some point in the future, even when the breach has not yet been confirmed by the full prediction model built on the historic trend data.

#### Service & Resource Management: Enhanced performance of ResourceManagerHelper.GetResources when using the ResourceExposers.ID.Equal filter [ID_37720]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 - FR 10.4.1 -->

Because of a number of enhancements, overall performance of the `ResourceManagerHelper.GetResources` method has increased when using a `ResourceExposers.ID.Equal` filter.

Also, the performance of `TrueFilterElement<Resource>` has been improved.

#### SLAnalytics - Behavioral anomaly detection: Enhanced coloring of trend graph change point indicators [ID_37827]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 - FR 10.4.1 -->

In a trend graph, the occurrence of change points is indicated by colored rectangular regions below the graph.

Up to now, these regions had a dark color when an alarm event would have been triggered for the change point in question if alarm monitoring had been activated for that type of change point.

From now on, a rectangular region will have a dark color when the change point in question actually triggered an event:

- a suggestion event (if alarm monitoring was not activated for that type of change point), or
- an alarm event (if alarm monitoring was activated for that type of change point).

#### Parameter ID range 10,000,000 to 10,999,999 now reserved [ID_37837]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 - FR 10.4.1 -->

Parameters IDs in the range of 10,000,000 to 10,999,999 are now reserved for DataMiner parameters. These will be used for DataMiner features in the future.

#### SLAnalytics: Enhanced error logging when retrieving trend data [ID_37931]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 - FR 10.4.1 -->

More extensive information will now be logged when errors occur while retrieving trend data.

#### Service & Resource Management: Migrating profiles and resources from XML to Elasticsearch/OpenSearch is no longer supported [ID_37979]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 - FR 10.4.2 -->

As storing profiles and resources in XML files is no longer supported as from DataMiner 10.4.0/10.4.1, migrating profiles and resources from XML to Elasticsearch/OpenSearch is now no longer supported as well. If you need to migrate profiles and resources, do so before you upgrade to version 10.4.0.

Also, the *NotAllClusterAgentsReachable* error in ResourceManager is now considered obsolete and will no longer be returned.

#### DataMiner Object Models: Reading DOM objects and ModuleSettings in parallel [ID_38023]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 - FR 10.4.2 -->

It is now possible to read DOM objects and ModuleSettings in parallel. This will considerably improve overall performance.

#### SLAnalytics - Behavioral anomaly detection: Reduction of memory used for trend icon calculation [ID_38041]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 - FR 10.4.2 -->

Up to now, SLAnalytics would always keep one hour of average trend data for all trended parameters on the system in order to determine which trend icon to display in the absence of change points. From now on, it will only keep one hour of trend data for 250,000 trended parameters at the most, reducing memory usage to a maximum of 330 MB.

#### SLAnalytics - Behavioral anomaly detection: Reduction of memory used for flatline detection [ID_38118]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 - FR 10.4.2 -->

The amount of memory used for flatline detection has been reduced.

### Fixes

#### Databases: Problem when starting a migration from MySQL to Cassandra [ID_37589]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 - FR 10.4.1 -->

When you started a migrating from a MySQL database to a Cassandra database, an error could occur when the connection to the MySQL database took a long time to get established.

#### Storage as a Service: Resources would not always be released correctly [ID_38058]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 - FR 10.4.2 -->

Resources would not always be released correctly, causing some resources to be used for longer than strictly necessary.

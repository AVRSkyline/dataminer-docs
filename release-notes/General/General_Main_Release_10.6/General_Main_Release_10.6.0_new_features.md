## New features

#### Retrieving additional logging from a DataMiner System [ID 40766]

<!-- MR 10.6.0 - FR 10.5.1 -->

From now on, the `GetAdditionalLoggingMessage` can be used to retrieve additional logging from a DataMiner System. It will return a `GetAdditionalLoggingResponseMessage` with the following information:

- *Log Name*: The name of the log.
- *Log Type*: The type of the log. Currently, only the log type "DxM" is supported.

Example:

```csharp
// Send a request to collect additional logging info 
var additionalLoggingMessage = new GetAdditionalLoggingMessage();
var response = engine.SendSLNetMessages(additionalLoggingMessage);
var loggingInfo = response.AdditionalLoggingInfo;
foreach (var logEntry in loggingInfo)
{
    engine.GenerateInformationEvent($"Log Name: {logEntry.Name}, Log Type: {logEntry.Type}");
}
```

Also, the existing messages `GetLogTextFileStringContentRequestMessage` and `GetLogTextFileBinaryContentRequestMessage` now have two new properties that will allow them to retrieve additional logging:

- *AdditionalLogName*: The name of the additional log to be retrieved.
- *LogType*: The type of the log. Example: `LogFileType.DxM`

Example:

```csharp
// Create a request to retrieve a specific additional log in a string format
var logRequest = new GetLogTextFileStringContentRequestMessage
{ 
    AdditionalLogName = "DataMiner UserDefinableApiEndpoint", 
    LogType = LogFileType.DxM
};
```

#### New SLNet call GetProtocolQActionsStateRequestMessage to retrieve QAction compilation warnings and errors [ID 41218]

<!-- MR 10.6.0 - FR 10.5.1 -->

A new SLNet call `GetProtocolQActionsStateRequestMessage` can now be used to retrieve the compilation warnings and errors of a given protocol and version. The response, `GetProtocolQActionsStateResponseMessage`, will then contains all faulty QActions and their respective warnings and errors.

In future versions, this call will be used to verify whether DataMiner Swarming can be enabled on a DataMiner System.

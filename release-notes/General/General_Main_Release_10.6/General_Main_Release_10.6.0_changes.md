## Changes

### Enhancements

#### DataMiner installer has been updated [ID 40409] [ID 41299]

<!-- MR 10.6.0 - FR 10.5.1 -->

The DataMiner installer has been updated.

When the configuration window appears, it will now be possible to either continue with the configuration or cancel the entire installation.

For more information on the installer, see [Installing DataMiner using the DataMiner Installer](xref:Installing_DM_using_the_DM_installer).

#### Legacy correlation engine is now deprecated [ID 40834]

<!-- MR 10.6.0 - FR 10.5.1 -->

The legacy correlation engine is now deprecated. As of this version, DataMiner will no longer support legacy correlation rules.

#### Clustering compatibility check enhancements [ID 41046]

<!-- MR 10.6.0 - FR 10.5.1 -->

When, in e.g. DataMiner Cube, you try to add a DataMiner Agent to the DataMiner System, a number of checks will be performed to determine whether the new Agent is compatible to be added.

The checks with regard to database compatibility have now been enhanced.

#### DataMiner upgrade packages now include the latest Visual C++ Redistributable [ID 41173]

<!-- MR 10.6.0 - FR 10.5.2 -->

All DataMiner upgrade packages now include the latest Visual C++ Redistributable.

> [!NOTE]
> From now on, after having upgraded a DataMiner Agent, the *C:\\Skyline DataMiner\\Files* and *C:\\Skyline DataMiner\\Files\\x64* folders will no longer contain any individual Visual C++ Redistributable DLL files.

#### SLAnalytics: Synchronization of the configuration.xml file can now be forced via Cube [ID 41270]

<!-- MR 10.6.0 - FR 10.5.1 -->

Up to now, when you had made changes to a *C:\\Skyline DataMiner\\Analytics\\configuration.xml* file on the leader Agent, you had to manually replace the file on all Agents in the cluster. From now on, you can force the synchronization of this file via Cube.

See also [Synchronizing data between DataMiner Agents](xref:Synchronizing_data_between_DataMiner_Agents)

#### Business intelligence: SLAs will now use alarm IDs with the syntax DMAID/ELEMENTID/ROOTID [ID 41328]

<!-- MR 10.6.0 - FR 10.5.1 -->

From now on, SLAs will use alarm IDs with the syntax DMAID/ELEMENTID/ROOTID. Up to now, they used alarm IDs with the syntax DMAID/AlarmID.

#### DataMiner upgrade: No longer possible to perform a 10.5.x web-only upgrade on DMAs running a version older than 10.4.x [ID 41395]

<!-- MR 10.6.0 - FR 10.5.1 -->

From now on, it will no longer be allowed to perform a 10.5.x web-only upgrade on DMAs running a DataMiner version older than 10.4.x.

If you want to perform a 10.5.x web-only upgrade on a DMA running e.g. version 10.3.x, you will first have to upgrade that DMA to 10.4.0.

#### SLAnalytics: Infinite parameter values will now be considered missing values [ID 41417]

<!-- MR 10.6.0 - FR 10.5.1 -->

When a parameter is set to an infinite value, SLAnalytics will now consider this infinite value as a missing value. This will prevent parameter changes of this type from disrupting analytical models.

#### SLLogCollector packages will now include the log files of the ModelHost and Copilot DxMs [ID 41464]

<!-- MR 10.6.0 - FR 10.5.1 -->

From now on, SLLogCollector packages will also include the log files of the *ModelHost* and *Copilot*\* DxMs.

*\*The Copilot feature is currently still being developed. It is not yet available for non-Skyline users*

#### Security enhancements [ID 41475]

<!-- 41475: MR 10.6.0 - FR 10.5.2 -->

A number of security enhancements have been made.

## Changes

### Enhancements

#### DataMiner installer has been updated [ID 40409] [ID 41299]

<!-- MR 10.6.0 - FR 10.5.1 -->

The DataMiner installer has been updated.

When the configuration window appears, it will now be possible to either continue with the configuration or cancel the entire installation.

For more information on the installer, see [Installing DataMiner using the DataMiner Installer](xref:Installing_DM_using_the_DM_installer).

#### Clustering compatibility check enhancements [ID 41046]

<!-- MR 10.6.0 - FR 10.5.1 -->

When, in e.g. DataMiner Cube, you try to add a DataMiner Agent to the DataMiner System, a number of checks will be performed to determine whether the new Agent is compatible to be added.

The checks with regard to database compatibility have now been enhanced.

#### Service & Resource Management: Process of starting blocking tasks has now been optimized [ID 41175]

<!-- MR 10.6.0 - FR 10.5.1 -->

Up to now, when blocking tasks with the same start time needed to be scheduled for several bookings, in some cases, bookings with limited start actions could get blocked by bookings with longer start actions.

Because of a number of enhancements, the process of starting blocking tasks has now been optimized.

#### SLAnalytics: Synchronization of the configuration.xml file can now be forced via Cube [ID 41270]

<!-- MR 10.6.0 - FR 10.5.1 -->

Up to now, when you had made changes to a *C:\\Skyline DataMiner\\Analytics\\configuration.xml* file on the leader Agent, you had to manually replace the file on all Agents in the cluster. From now on, you can force the synchronization of this file via Cube.

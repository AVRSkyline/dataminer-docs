### Enhancements

#### DataMiner Cube - Visual Overview: Enhanced service chain behavior [ID_37645]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU22]/10.3.0 [CU10] - FR 10.4.1 -->

A number of UI enhancements have been made with regard to service chain behavior in visual overviews.

Up to now, in some cases, service chains could get redrawn too often, or shapes would not get redrawn when a service chain was updated. Also, context menus of shapes would not always close when those shapes were updated and context menus would incorrectly show the *Display connectivity* command twice.

#### DataMiner Cube - Spectrum Analysis: Buttons in 'Reference lines' panel, 'Thresholds' panel and 'Measurement Points' panel have been restyled [ID_37752]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU22]/10.3.0 [CU10] - FR 10.4.1 -->

In the *View* tab of a spectrum card, the buttons in the *Reference lines* panel and the *Thresholds* panel as well as the delete buttons in the *Measurement Points* panel have been restyled to match the buttons in the *Markers* panel.

### Fixes

#### DataMiner Cube - Visual Overview: Placeholder containing '[Elapsed Time]' would not be updated when the elapsed time had changed [ID_37756]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU22]/10.3.0 [CU10] - FR 10.4.1 -->

When the placeholder `[Elapsed Time]` was used inside another placeholder (e.g. `[Subtract:[Elapsed Time],[PreRoll]]`), the entire placeholder (e.g. `[Subtract:[Elapsed Time],[PreRoll]]`) would not be updated when the elapsed time had changed.

#### DataMiner Cube - Pattern matching: Memory leak [ID_37771]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU22]/10.3.0 [CU10] - FR 10.4.1 -->

DataMiner Cube could start leaking memory when you opened trend graphs with pattern matching.

#### SLAnalytics: Problem when the alarm repository was not available at startup [ID_37782]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU22]/10.3.0 [CU10] - FR 10.4.1 -->

In some cases, an error could occur in SLAnalytics when it was not able to connect to the alarm repository at startup.

#### DataMiner Cube - Data Display: Problem when hovering over lite parameter controls in Skyline Black theme [ID_37814]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU22]/10.3.0 [CU10] - FR 10.4.1 -->

When DataMiner Cube was using the *Skyline Black* theme, lite parameter controls would become unreadable when you hovered over them.

#### Entire SNMPv3 response would be discarded when one or more cells contained 'no such instance' [ID_37815]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU22]/10.3.0 [CU10] - FR 10.4.1 -->

When a table was polled via SNMPv3 and the response included a cell that contained *no such instance*, the table would not get populated with the values that were received. Instead, the entire result set would be discarded.

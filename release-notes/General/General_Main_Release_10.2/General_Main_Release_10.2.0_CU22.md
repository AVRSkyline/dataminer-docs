### Enhancements

#### DataMiner Cube - Visual Overview: Enhanced service chain behavior [ID_37645]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU22]/10.3.0 [CU10] - FR 10.4.1 -->

A number of UI enhancements have been made with regard to service chain behavior in visual overviews.

Up to now, in some cases, service chains could get redrawn too often, or shapes would not get redrawn when a service chain was updated. Also, context menus of shapes would not always close when those shapes were updated and context menus would incorrectly show the *Display connectivity* command twice.

#### DataMiner Cube - Spectrum Analysis: Buttons in 'Reference lines' panel, 'Thresholds' panel and 'Measurement Points' panel have been restyled [ID_37752]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU22]/10.3.0 [CU10] - FR 10.4.1 -->

In the *View* tab of a spectrum card, the buttons in the *Reference lines* panel and the *Thresholds* panel as well as the delete buttons in the *Measurement Points* panel have been restyled to match the buttons in the *Markers* panel.

### Fixes

#### DataMiner Cube - Relation learning: Problem when checking ModelHost DxM license [ID_37653]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU22]/10.3.0 [CU10] - FR 10.4.1 -->

In some cases, DataMiner Cube could become unresponsive when checking the ModelHost DxM license.

#### DataMiner Cube - Pattern matching: Memory leak [ID_37771]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU22]/10.3.0 [CU10] - FR 10.4.1 -->

DataMiner Cube could start leaking memory when you opened trend graphs with pattern matching.

### Enhancements

*No enhancements have been added yet.*

### Fixes

#### Memory leaks when an element that was used in an alarm level link configuration was restarted [ID 40997]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU10]/10.5.0 [CU1] - FR 10.5.1 -->

When an element that was used in an alarm level link configuration was restarted, in some cases, both SLElement and SLProtocol could leak memory, as would SLDataMiner when the alarm level links were pushed to locked elements.

For more information on the `<AlarmLevelLinks>` element, see [How to aggregate alarm severities](xef:How_to_aggregate_alarm_severities)

#### SLElement would leak memory when filtering a recursive table or a directview/view table that had to be sorted [ID 41058]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU10]/10.5.0 [CU1] - FR 10.5.1 -->

When SLElement had to process a table filter request, it would leak memory in the following cases:

- When the table had a foreign key to itself.
- When a directview or view table with a number of non-initialized columns had to be sorted.

#### LDAP/ActiveDirectory domain users would no longer be able to log in [ID 41143]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU10]/10.5.0 [CU1] - FR 10.5.1 -->

Since DataMiner 10.4.0 [CU4]/10.4.7, in some cases, LDAP/ActiveDirectory domain users would no longer be able to log in. When such a user tried to log in, the following entry would be added to the SLNet.txt log file:

`Authentication Step Failure: Not a DataMiner user: CONTOSA\user`

This issue would only occur on LDAP servers where `CN=CONTOSA,CN=Partitions,CN=Configuration,DC=contosa,DC=com` does not have a `nETBIOSName` attribute, for example when accessing the GlobalCatalog of a forest.

After having upgraded to a DataMiner version that contains this fix, you can do the following:

- Wait up to an hour for the next LDAP synchronization to occur, or
- Manually trigger the "Skyline DataMiner LDAP Resync" task in Windows Task Scheduler.

All users should then be able to log in again.

#### STaaS: Excessive number of duplicate entries added to the SLErrors.txt log file in case of connection problems [ID 41192]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU10]/10.5.0 [CU1] - FR 10.5.1 -->

On STaaS systems, in case of connection problems, a large number of the following errors would be added to the *SLErrors.txt* log file:

- *The remote name could not be resolved.*
- *Unable to connect to the remote server.*

From now on, in case of connection problems, the generation of *SLErrors.txt* log file entries will be throttled in order to reduce the number of duplicate entries.

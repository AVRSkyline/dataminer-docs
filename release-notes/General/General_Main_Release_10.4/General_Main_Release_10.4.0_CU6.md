### Enhancements

#### SLAnalytics: Alarms and suggestion events for virtual functions will now be generated on the parent element [ID_39707]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU18]/10.4.0 [CU6] - FR 10.4.9 -->

When, in the scope of behavioral anomaly detection, proactive cap detection or pattern matching, SLAnalytics has to generate alarms or suggestion events for virtual functions, from now on, it will generate them on the parent element. However, it will continue to generate alarms and suggestion events for all other kinds of DVEs on the child element.

#### NATS configuration can now be reset by calling an endpoint of SLEndpointTool.dll [ID_39871]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU18]/10.4.0 [CU6] - FR 10.4.8 -->

From now on, the NATS configuration can be reset by calling the following endpoint in e.g. an Automation script:

`SLEndpointTool.Config.NATSConfigManager.ResetNATSConfiguration()`

#### DataMiner upgrade: ResetConfig.txt will no longer be added to FilesToDelete.txt [ID_39994]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU18]/10.4.0 [CU6] - FR 10.4.9 -->

Every DataMiner upgrade package includes a *FilesToDelete.txt* file, which lists all files in the *C:\\Skyline DataMiner\\* folder that should be deleted during the upgrade procedure. From now on, the *ResetConfig.txt* file will no longer be added to that list of files to be deleted.

The *C:\\Skyline DataMiner\\Files\\ResetConfig.txt* file is a file used by the factory reset tool *SLReset.exe* as a whitelist to determine which files to keep. The first time *SLReset.exe* is executed, the default whitelist is added to *ResetConfig.txt*. Afterwards, you can add files you want to keep to this whitelist, so that these are not removed when the tool is executed again. If you delete *ResetConfig.txt*, the default whitelist will be used again.

#### Storage as a Service: Event hub throttling errors will now be logged as 'Warning' instead of 'Error' [ID_40018]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU6] - FR 10.4.9 -->

From now on, event hub throttling errors will be logged as 'Warning' instead of 'Error'.

### Fixes

#### Problem with SLElement while processing table parameter updates [ID_39462]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU6] - FR 10.4.9 -->

In some cases, SLElement could stop working while processing table parameter updates.

#### Problem due to the protobuf-net framework in SLNetTypes being initialized on multiple threads [ID_39807]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU18]/10.4.0 [CU6] - FR 10.4.9 -->

On heavily loaded systems, in some cases, the protobuf-net framework in SLNetTypes would simultaneously be initialized on multiple threads, causing the following exception to be thrown:

`Timeout while inspecting metadata; this may indicate a deadlock. This can often be avoided by preparing necessary serializers during application initialization, rather than allowing multiple threads to perform the initial metadata inspection; please also see the LockContended event`

#### SLNet - CloudEndpointManager: Problem at startup when NATS and NAS services were not installed [ID_39980]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU18]/10.4.0 [CU6] - FR 10.4.9 -->

At startup, in some cases, the CloudEndpointManager in SLNet could throw an exception when the NATS and NAS services were not installed.

#### Service & Resource Management: Problem when a DMA did not respond during the midnight sync of the Resource Manager [ID_40021]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU18]/10.4.0 [CU6] - FR 10.4.9 -->

When a DMA did not respond during the midnight synchronization (e.g. because the Resource Manager had not been initialized on that DMA), up to now, a nullreference exception would be thrown directly after the error had been logged.

### Enhancements

#### SLAnalytics - Behavioral anomaly detection: Enhanced detection of anomalous flatline change points [ID_39720]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU5] - FR 10.4.8 -->

A number of enhancements have been made to the process that determines whether a flatline change point is considered to be anomalous or not.

#### 'Security Advisory' BPA test will no longer report an issue when NATS does not have TLS enabled on a single DMA [ID_39792]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU17]/10.4.0 [CU5] - FR 10.4.8 -->

When the [Security Advisory](xref:BPA_Security_Advisory) BPA test was run on a single DataMiner Agent of which firewall port 4222 and 6222 were closed, up to now, it would report an issue saying that NATS did not have TLS enabled.

As NATS does not need TLS enabled on single DataMiner Agents, from now on, the [Security Advisory](xref:BPA_Security_Advisory) BPA test will only report an issue regarding NATS TLS when, on a single DataMiner Agent, firewall ports 4222 and 6222 are open.

#### 'Security Advisory' BPA test: Enhanced testing of HTTP and HTTPS connections [ID_39813]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU17]/10.4.0 [CU5] - FR 10.4.8 -->

A number of enhancements have been made to the [Security Advisory](xref:BPA_Security_Advisory) BPA test with regard to the testing of HTTP and HTTPS connections.

### Fixes

#### SLLogCollector: 'Access is denied' errors [ID_39364]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU17]/10.4.0 [CU5] - FR 10.4.8 -->

In some cases, SLLogCollector would not have the required permissions to access process objects or execute certain WMI queries. As a result, `Access is denied` errors would be added to the *SLLogCollector.txt* log file.

#### Problem with SLASPConnection when an email message could not be delivered [ID_39759]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU17]/10.4.0 [CU5] - FR 10.4.8 -->

In some cases, a fatal error could occur in SLASPConnection when an email message could not be delivered.

#### GQI: 'Get trend data patterns' data source would incorrectly return the pattern ID instead of the linked pattern ID [ID_39811]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU5] - FR 10.4.7 [CU0] -->

The *Get trend data patterns* data source would incorrectly return the pattern ID instead of the linked pattern ID.

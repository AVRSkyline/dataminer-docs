### Enhancements

#### APIGateway now runs on .NET 8 and allows you to enable kernel response buffering [ID_38710]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU14] / 10.4.0 [CU2] - FR 10.4.5 -->

APIGateway has been upgraded. It now runs on Microsoft .NET 8.

This service now allows you to enable kernel response buffering, which should improve throughput and responsiveness over high-latency connections. This setting is disabled by default. To enable it, do the following:

1. In the `C:\Program Files\Skyline Communications\DataMiner APIGateway\` folder of the DataMiner Agent, create a JSON file named *appsettings.custom.json*.
1. Open this JSON file, and add the following content:

   ```json
   { "HostingOptions": { "EnableKernelResponseBuffering": true } }
   ```

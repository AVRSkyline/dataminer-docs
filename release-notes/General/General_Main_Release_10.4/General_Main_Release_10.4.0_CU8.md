### Enhancements

#### Failover: Virtual IP address check will now use both a ping and an arp command to check whether an IP address is free [ID_40516]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU20]/10.4.0 [CU8] - FR 10.4.11 -->

Up to now, on systems that do not allow ping commands to be executed, in some cases, the virtual IP address check would incorrectly conclude that the IP address was free and decide to claim it, causing the network interface card to malfunction due to IP addresses not being unique.

From now on, when the virtual IP address check has concluded that the IP address is free after having executed the required number of ping commands, it will double-check by executing an arp command.

### Enhancements

#### Cassandra & Cassandra cluster: Enhanced performance when querying the maskstate table [ID_39192]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU16]/10.4.0 [CU4] - FR 10.4.7 -->

Because of a number of enhancements, on systems using a Cassandra and Cassandra cluster database, overall performance has increased when querying the maskstate database table. As a result, elements will start up quicker depending on the number of masked objects in the database.

#### Service & Resource Management: Enhanced performance when creating multiple bookings simultaneously [ID_39390]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU16]/10.4.0 [CU4] - FR 10.4.7 -->

Because of a number of enhancements, overall performance has increased when creating multiple bookings simultaneously.

#### Security enhancements [ID_38263] [ID_39611]

<!-- 38263: MR 10.3.0 [CU16]/10.4.0 [CU4] - FR 10.4.3 -->
<!-- 39611: MR 10.3.0 [CU16]/10.4.0 [CU4] - FR 10.4.7 -->

A number of security enhancements have been made.

### Fixes

#### Issues with user accounts [ID_39234]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU4] - FR 10.4.7 -->

In some cases, user accounts could become corrupted and group memberships could get lost.

Also, in some cases, SLDataMiner could stop working when an alarm template or trend template was uploaded, removed, assigned or unassigned.

#### Problem with SLNet when information on hanging calls was being retrieved [ID_39373]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU16]/10.4.0 [CU4] - FR 10.4.7 -->

In some rare cases, an error could occur in SLNet when information on hanging calls was being retrieved.

#### SLSNMPAgent would incorrectly interpret variable trap bindings of type 'IpAddress' as bindings of type 'OctetString' [ID_39425]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU16]/10.4.0 [CU4] - FR 10.4.7 -->

Up to now, SLSNMPAgent would incorrectly interpret variable trap bindings of type 'IpAddress' as bindings of type 'OctetString'.

#### Protocols: 'next' attribute would no longer work for SNMP parameters [ID_39430]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU16]/10.4.0 [CU4] - FR 10.4.7 -->

The `next` attribute of a parameter inside a parameter group determines the number of milliseconds DataMiner has to wait before reading the next parameter. This functionality no longer worked for SNMP parameters.

Also, when a group contained single parameters in combination with a partial table, the single parameters would incorrectly also be requested each time the next batch of rows were requested from the partial table. From now on, the single parameters will only be requested once.

> [!NOTE]
> When a `next` attribute is defined on a partial SNMP table parameter inside a parameter group, then the delay will also be applied between the batches of rows that are requested.

### Fixes

#### Dashboards app: Problem when running a GQI query multiple times in quick succession [ID 41246]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU10] / 10.5.0 [CU1] - FR 10.5.1 -->

When a GQI query was run multiple times in quick succession, in some cases, a `Session does not exist` error could appear.

#### Dashboards/Low-Code Apps - Alarm table component: Time filter would be disregarded when fetching history alarms [ID 41249]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU10] / 10.5.0 [CU1] - FR 10.5.1 -->

When an *Alarm table* component was configured to retrieve history alarms, it would incorrectly always retrieve all history alarms from the database, regardless of what was specified in the time filter.

#### Dashboards/Low-Code Apps: No chart data would be shown when a parameter value was fed to a Line & area chart component linked to a Time range component [ID 41252]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU10] / 10.5.0 [CU1] - FR 10.5.1 -->

When the value of a parameter selected in another component (e.g. a *Gauge* or a *Ring* component) was fed to a *Line & area chart* component that was linked to a *Time range* component, in some cases, the *Line & area chart* component would not show any data.

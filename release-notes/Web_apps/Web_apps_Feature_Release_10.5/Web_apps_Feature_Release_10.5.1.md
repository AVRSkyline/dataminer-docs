### Fixes

#### Dashboards/Low-Code Apps - Web component: Default margin would incorrectly no longer be 0px when showing custom HTML [ID 41241]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU10] / 10.5.0 [CU1] - FR 10.5.1 -->

The default margin of a *Web* component in which *Type* was set to "Custom HTML" would incorrectly no longer be 0px. This would cause scrollbars to appear.

#### Dashboards/Low-Code Apps - Alarm table component: Time filter would be disregarded when fetching history alarms [ID 41249]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU10] / 10.5.0 [CU1] - FR 10.5.1 -->

When an *Alarm table* component was configured to retrieve history alarms, it would incorrectly always retrieve all history alarms from the database, regardless of what was specified in the time filter.

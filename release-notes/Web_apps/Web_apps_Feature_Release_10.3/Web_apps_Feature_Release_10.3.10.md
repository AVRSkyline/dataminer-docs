## Changes

### Enhancements

#### Legacy Monitoring & Control app no longer available [ID_36953]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.10 -->

The legacy Monitoring & Control app (obsolete since DataMiner 10.0.0/10.0.2) is no longer available. If you browse to `http(s)://[DMA]/m`, you will now be redirected to the regular Monitoring app.

#### Security enhancements [ID_37051] [ID_37086]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU7]/10.4.0 - FR 10.3.10 -->

A number of security enhancements have been made.

### Fixes

#### Dashboards app/Low-Code Apps: Error when data source contained cells with NaN value [ID_36923]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.10 -->

Up to now, when a data source contained cells with the value "NaN", an error message was shown in the Dashboards app or Low-Code Apps.

This has been fixed. The display value will remain "NaN", but the raw value will now be null.

#### Dashboards app/Low-Code Apps: Changing query column while it was loading made it stop loading [ID_37006]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.10 -->

Up to now, if a column of a query was edited while the query was loading in a table component of a dashboard or low-code app, it would stop loading, and an empty table would temporarily be shown.

#### Dashboards app/Low-Code Apps: Visual glitch when closing component menu [ID_37058]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU19]/10.3.0 [CU7] - FR 10.3.10 -->

When the menu of a component in a dashboard or low-code app was closed by moving the mouse pointer out of it at the bottom center, a visual glitch could occur where the menu appeared to rapidly open and close.

#### Dashboards app/Low-Code Apps: Query filter not applied on sorted table [ID_37070]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.10 -->
<!-- Not added in 10.4.0: fixes a feature introduced in that version -->

In a dashboard or low-code app, if sorting was applied to one or more columns of a table, it could occur that a query filter could not be correctly applied on the table, so that the unfiltered result was shown instead.

#### Dashboards app: 'Copy embed URL' right-click option continued to be displayed [ID_37090]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.10 -->

In some cases, it could occur that the *Copy embed URL* right-click option of a dashboard component continued to be displayed when it should not have been. This specifically occurred when you moved or resized the component or when you closed and reopened edit mode while the option was displayed.

#### Monitoring app: Filtered combo box control not shown correctly in Visual Overview [ID_37107]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU19]/10.3.0 [CU7] - FR 10.3.10 -->

In the Monitoring app, it could occur that Visual Overview parameter control shapes configured to show a filtered combo box control (i.e. with *SetVarOptions* set to *Control=FilterComboBox*) were not displayed correctly.

#### GQI: Missing column statistics for discrete options of numeric columns [ID_37111]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.10 -->

When the web API fetched information for columns of a GQI query, it could occur that not all statistics were included. In the Dashboards app/Low-Code Apps, this could lead to incorrect "(0)" counters next to the discrete options of numeric columns in the query filter when the filter assistance option was enabled.

#### Dashboards app: Shared dashboard containing query with 'Start from' data source not loading [ID_37115]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.10 -->

If a shared dashboard contained a query that built on another query (using the "Start from" data source), in some cases it could occur that the dashboard could not be loaded and the loading screen continued to be displayed.

#### Low-Code Apps: Time range component overlay not fully displayed [ID_37118]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.10 -->

When you click a time range component in a low-code app, an overlay is displayed where you can select a time range. In some cases, it could occur that part of this overlay could not be displayed.

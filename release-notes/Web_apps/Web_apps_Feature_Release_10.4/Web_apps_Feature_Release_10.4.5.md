## Changes

### Enhancements

#### Dashboards app & Low-Code Apps - Query filter component: Enhanced button coloring [ID_38754]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU14] / 10.4.0 [CU2] - FR 10.4.5 -->

Up to now, the buttons in the *Query filter* component would be barely visible when the color of the app was similar to the background color of the theme. From now on, the buttons in the *Query filter* component will always have the text color of the theme.

#### Web apps: Enhanced performance when starting up [ID_38999]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU14] / 10.4.0 [CU2] - FR 10.4.5 -->

Because of a number of enhancements, overall performance has increased when starting up a DataMiner web app.

### Fixes

#### Dashboards app & Low-Code Apps - Dropdown component: Filter would no longer be applied after losing the focus [ID_38834]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU14] / 10.4.0 [CU2] - FR 10.4.5 -->

When a *Dropdown* component with a filter applied lost the focus, the moment it had the focus again, the filter would no longer be applied.

#### Dashboards app: Problem with Dropdown components on shared dashboards [ID_38953]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU14] / 10.4.0 [CU2] - FR 10.4.5 -->

When, on a shared dashboard, a *Dropdown* component had a time range or service definition filter applied, it would not be possible to use that component.

## New features

#### Dashboards app & Low-Code Apps - Node edge graph component: New features & enhanced performance [ID_38974]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU14] / 10.4.0 [CU2] - FR 10.4.5 -->
<!-- For fixes in RN 38974, see Fixes section below -->

A number of new features have been added to the *Node edge graph* component:

- In low-code apps, a new node edge graph action can now be used: *Clear the data*. When executed, this action will clear the feed status of the node edge graph in question.
- Similar to other GQI components, a node edge graph is now able to recover selections (coming from the URL or when navigating between pages in low-code apps).
- You can now force edge labels to become fully visible by pressing *CTRL+SPACE*.

Also, because of a number of enhancements, overall node edge graph performance has increased.

#### Dashboards app & Low-Code Apps: Client metric logging [ID_39000]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU14] / 10.4.0 [CU2] - FR 10.4.5 -->

In the `C:\Skyline DataMiner\Logging\Web` folder, apart from Web API logging, you can now also find client metric logging.

Client metric logging is employed to record different performance and issue indicators of clients connecting to Dashboards and Low-Code Apps. These logs encompass everything from unexpected errors to the load time of a dashboard or low-code app page. This logging data is stored in the `Client` subfolder of the web logs.

## Changes

### Breaking changes

#### Low-Code Apps: Parameters of a script action linked to an empty feed will now be filled with an empty array [ID_39027]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU14] / 10.4.0 [CU2] - FR 10.4.5 -->

Up to now, when a script parameter of a *Launch a script* action was linked to a feed, that parameters would be set to null when the feed was empty.

From now on, linking a script parameter to an empty feed will fill it with an empty array instead. The dialog to manually enter a parameter will no longer be shown when the action is launched. This change can break existing implementations when it is not handled by the script.

### Enhancements

#### Dashboards app & Low-Code Apps - Query filter component: Enhanced button coloring [ID_38754]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU14] / 10.4.0 [CU2] - FR 10.4.5 -->

Up to now, the buttons in the *Query filter* component would be barely visible when the color of the app was similar to the background color of the theme. From now on, the buttons in the *Query filter* component will always have the text color of the theme.

#### Dashboards app & Low-Code Apps: Grouping of GQI event messages [ID_38959]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU14] / 10.4.0 [CU2] - FR 10.4.5 -->

From now on, GQI event messages sent by the same GQI session within a time frame of 100 ms will be grouped into one single message.

#### Dashboards app & Low-Code Apps: Template editor will now inherit the background color of the component [ID_38996]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU14] / 10.4.0 [CU2] - FR 10.4.5 -->

From now on, the template editor will inherit the background color of the component. This will enhance overall visibility regardless of the chosen theme.

#### Web apps: Enhanced performance when starting up [ID_38999]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU14] / 10.4.0 [CU2] - FR 10.4.5 -->

Because of a number of enhancements, overall performance has increased when starting up a DataMiner web app.

#### Landing page - Other apps: No longer possible to right-click apps on mobile devices [ID_39036]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU14] / 10.4.0 [CU2] - FR 10.4.5 -->

When you open the landing page of a DataMiner Agent (e.g. `https://myDMA/root/`) on a mobile device, it will no longer be possible to open the context menu of apps listed in the *Other apps* section.

### Fixes

#### Dashboards app & Low-Code Apps - Dropdown component: Filter would no longer be applied after losing the focus [ID_38834]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU14] / 10.4.0 [CU2] - FR 10.4.5 -->

When a *Dropdown* component with a filter applied lost the focus, the moment it had the focus again, the filter would no longer be applied.

#### Dashboards app: Problem with Dropdown components on shared dashboards [ID_38953]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU14] / 10.4.0 [CU2] - FR 10.4.5 -->

When, on a shared dashboard, a *Dropdown* component had a time range or service definition filter applied, it would not be possible to use that component.

#### Dashboards app & Low-Code Apps - Node edge graph component: Issues fixed [ID_38974]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU14] / 10.4.0 [CU2] - FR 10.4.5 -->
<!-- For new features & enhancements in RN 38974, see New features section above -->

A number of issues related to Node edge graph component have been solved:

- When a node edge graph was linked to the query filter, in some cases, the filter would not be applied correctly for nodes/edges that were not visible in the view. Panning towards those nodes/edges would then show them as hidden/visible while they should be visible/hidden.
- Up to now, a node edge graph would incorrectly reset its viewport when the query or filter had changed.
- In some cases, the edge coloring/highlighting would incorrectly not be applied for parameters with very small numeric values.

#### Web apps: Context menu would not close when scrolling on a mobile device [ID_38992]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU14] / 10.4.0 [CU2] - FR 10.4.5 -->

When, on a mobile device, you scrolled while a context menu was open, that context menu would incorrectly not close.

## Changes

### Enhancements

#### Web apps: Improved startup performance because of waffle menu enhancements [ID_39208]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU15] / 10.4.0 [CU3] - FR 10.4.6 -->

Because of a number of enhancements made to the waffle menu, overall performance has increased when opening a web app.

### Fixes

#### Dashboards app & Low-Code Apps - Template editor: Save button would not become available when you enabled a setting in an override [ID_39290]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU15] / 10.4.0 [CU3] - FR 10.4.6 -->

When, after adding an override, you saved and re-opened the template editor, the *Save* button would not become available when you enabled one of the settings in the override. The *Save* button would incorrectly only become available after you had changed the value of the setting you enabled.

#### Dashboards app & Low-Code Apps - Template editor: Save button would incorrectly be available when opening the template editor [ID_39297]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU15] / 10.4.0 [CU3] - FR 10.4.6 -->

When you made a change in the template editor, saved the template, and opened the editor again, up to now, the *Save* button would incorrectly be available. When you then closed the template editor without making any changes, a popup window would appear, saying that there were unsaved changes.

From now on, when you open the template editor, the *Save* button will be unavailable by default. Only after have made a change will this button become available.

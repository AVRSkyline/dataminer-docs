#### Web apps: Users would not get logged in after pressing ENTER on the authentication page [ID_39961]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU18] / 10.4.0 [CU6] - FR 10.4.9 -->

When, on a mobile device, you entered your credentials on the authentication page of a DataMiner web app and pressed ENTER, you would incorrectly not be logged in. Instead, the authentication page would simply refresh.

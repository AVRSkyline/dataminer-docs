#### Low-Code Apps: Panels would not stack in the correct order [ID_37696]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU10] - FR 10.4.1 -->

Panels would not stack in the correct order. From now on, they will stack in the order in which they were opened, and panels opening as pop-up windows will always stack on top of the left/right panels.

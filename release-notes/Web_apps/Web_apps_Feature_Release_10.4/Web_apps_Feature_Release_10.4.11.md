## Changes

### Enhancements

#### Dashboards/Low-Code Apps - Time range component: Apply and Cancel buttons [ID 40622]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU20] / 10.4.0 [CU8] - FR 10.4.11 -->

Up to now, when you set a custom time range in the *Time range* component, the feed of the component would immediately be updated. From now on, the feed will only be updated when you click the *Apply* button.

Clicking the *Cancel* button will close the time range picker without updating the feed.

### Fixes

#### Dashboards app: Folders of which the name contained a slash ('/') or a backslash ('\\') character would stay hidden [ID 40532]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU20] / 10.4.0 [CU8] - FR 10.4.11 -->

When you created a dashboard folder of which the name contained a slash ("/") or a backslash ("\\") character, up to now, the folder would be created, but would stay hidden. It would not appear in the folder structure.

From now on, when you enter a folder name containing a slash ("/") or a backslash ("\\") character, an `Invalid folder name message` will appear.

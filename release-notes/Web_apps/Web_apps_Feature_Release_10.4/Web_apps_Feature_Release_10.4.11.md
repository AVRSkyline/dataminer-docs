### Fixes

#### Dashboards app: Folders of which the name contained a slash ('/') or a backslash ('\\') character would stay hidden [ID_40532]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU20] / 10.4.0 [CU8] - FR 10.4.11 -->

When you created a dashboard folder of which the name contained a slash ("/") or a backslash ("\\") character, up to now, the folder would be created, but would stay hidden. It would not appear in the folder structure.

From now on, when you enter a folder name containing a slash ("/") or a backslash ("\\") character, an `Invalid folder name message` will appear.

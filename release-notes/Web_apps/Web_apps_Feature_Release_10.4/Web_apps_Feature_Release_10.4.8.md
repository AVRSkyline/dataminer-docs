### Fixes

#### Dashboards app & Low-Code Apps: Interactive Automation scripts launched from a node edge graph or a context menu action would not inherit the theme of the dashboard or low-code app [ID_39664]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU17] / 10.4.0 [CU5] - FR 10.4.8 -->

When an interactive Automation script was launched from a node edge graph or a context menu action, the script would incorrectly not inherit the theme of the dashboard or low-code app.

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU17] / 10.4.0 [CU5] - FR 10.4.8 -->

After a dashboard or a low-code app had been migrated from DataMiner server version 10.3.8 to DataMiner server version 10.3.9 or later,feed links defined in the *Web* component, the *Text* component or the *Navigate to a URL* action would no longer work.

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU17] / 10.4.0 [CU5] - FR 10.4.8 -->

When a low-code app executed an *Opening an app* action in which no app had been specified, an error would occur.

From now on, when an incorrectly configured action is detected, it will no longer be executed. Instead, an error message will appear.

#### Dashboards app & Low-Code Apps: Problem when a Form component had to show the same data to multiple users [ID_39801]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU17] / 10.4.0 [CU5] - FR 10.4.8 -->

When a *Form* component on a dashboard or in a low-code app had to show the same data to multiple users, in some rare cases, an error could occur in the web APIs, causing the component to not show any data at all.

#### Low-Code Apps: Form component not able to create instances [ID_39808]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU17] / 10.4.0 [CU5] - FR 10.4.8 -->

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU17] / 10.4.0 [CU5] - FR 10.4.8 -->

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU17] / 10.4.0 [CU5] - FR 10.4.8 -->

In a dashboard, in some cases, components showing the result of a query filtered by feeds would not get updated when the feed values changed.

Also, in some cases, a query could keep on updating when it was linked to a time range feed that exposed a sliding window (e.g. "last 5 minutes").

#### Dashboards app & Low-Code Apps - Pie & donut chart component: Pie chart would not re-appear after an error message had disappeared [ID_39879]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU17] / 10.4.0 [CU5] - FR 10.4.8 -->

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU17] / 10.4.0 [CU5] - FR 10.4.8 -->

#### Web API would incorrectly retrieve the time zone from the user-specific ClientSettings.json file [ID_39897]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU17] / 10.4.0 [CU5] - FR 10.4.8 -->

Up to now, the web API would incorrectly retrieve the current time zone from the *ClientSettings.json* file located in the user-specific *C:\\Skyline DataMiner\\users\\<username>\\* folder.

From now on, the current time zone will be retrieved from the *ClientSettings.json* file located in the *C:\\Skyline DataMiner\\users\\* folder, which applies to all users.

#### Low-Code Apps: The app would incorrectly open in edit mode when you clicked 'Preview draft' [ID_39935]

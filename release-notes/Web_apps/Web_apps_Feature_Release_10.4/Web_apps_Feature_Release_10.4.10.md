## Changes

### Enhancements

#### Dashboards/Low-Code Apps: Queries with ad hoc data source with missing argument no longer executed [ID_40361]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU19] / 10.4.0 [CU7] - FR 10.4.10 -->

When one or more required arguments for an ad hoc data source are missing because of an empty feed, the query using the data source will now no longer be executed and an empty visual will be shown. Previously, an error about the missing argument was thrown instead in this situation.

#### Sharing pop-up loader background adjusted [ID_40408]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU19] / 10.4.0 [CU7] - FR 10.4.10 -->

When you share a dashboard in the cloud, the loader that is shown while a new tab opens where you can configure the cloud share will now have the same background as the pop-up window containing the loader. Previously, there was a slight color difference between the loader background and the rest of the pop-up window.

### Fixes

#### Dashboards/Low-Code Apps: Intellisense no longer working when feed is configured with special character [ID_40340] [ID_40446]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU19] / 10.4.0 [CU7] - FR 10.4.10 -->

When special characters such as "(" were used when configuring a feed, Intellisense no longer worked correctly.

#### Dashboards: Dashboard PDF set to A0 format generated as A4 instead [ID_40398]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU19] / 10.4.0 [CU7] - FR 10.4.10 -->

When you created a PDF of a dashboard, and you set the *Paper format* to A0, the dashboard was incorrectly generated in A4 format instead.

### Fixes

#### Dashboards app/Low-Code Apps: Problem with custom time zones [ID_37278]

<!-- 10.2.0 [CU20]/MR 10.3.0 [CU8] - FR 10.3.11 -->

When a custom time zone was used, in some cases, that time zone would not be processed correctly.

For example, when you set a custom time zone in a *Clock* component, the current time of that custom time zone would not be identical to the current time of the local time zone.

> [!NOTE]
> This problem would mostly occur when using a time zone that does not observe daylight saving time (e.g. Altai Standard Time).

# DIS 3.0

## Changes

### Enhancements

#### Remove warnings on QAction_Helper project [ID_39643]

When the QAction_Helper project would be generated by DIS (e.g. when converting xml to a protocol solution), a lot of warnings would be thrown by Visual Studio. These should not be shown as that is auto-generated code. A change was made so the generated project would be the same as the Visual Studio Templates which will disable the warnings for that project.

#### Dropped support for Visual Studio 2019 [ID_39719]

DIS will not be supported on Visual Studio 2019 anymore.

#### DIS is on Visual Studio Marketplace [ID_39747]

DIS has been published on the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=skyline-communications.DataMinerIntegrationStudio)!

With this, the *Update* tab in the DIS Settings has been removed as Visual Studio contains functionality to automatically notify and/or update extensions.
